The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n2 \n The goal of th is report is to synthesize learnings from studies from \naround the company versus to completely describe each individual \nstudy. Many of the studies are or will be the subject of dedicated \nreports or research papers , and we have provided links to those \ndocuments where they are already available. Most of the studies \nhave not yet been through peer review and as such they have not \nhad the chance thus far to incorporate external reviewer feedback. \nFurther, before continuing , it is important to acknowledge that all \nwork here was funded by Microsoft, which has a commercial \ninterest in improving and demonstrating the degree to which \nCopilot increases worker productivity.  \n2 RELATED WORK  \nResearchers outside of Microsoft also have been moving to study \ngenerative AI \u2019s impact on productivity in real-world contexts. This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI\u2019s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people\u2019s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations. For example, for the question \"Using Copilot in Teams \nallows me to attend fewer meetings,\" those using Copilot for 3 -6  \nFigure 2. Variable importance in predicting AI power usage  \nGenerative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n5 \n weeks had an average response of 2.66 ( variance 0.81) and those \nwith more than 10 weeks of usage had an average of 3.06 ( variance \n1.34). For the question \u201cUsing Copilot helps me to enjoy my work \nmore\u201d the average for the 3 -6 week group was 3.4 and for the over \n10-weeks group it was 3.6.  All results reported in this analysis are \nstatistically significant, as confirmed by ANOVA tests (p < 0.05).  \n \nIt is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this self-reported \ndata. While  researchers  found significant associations, establishing \ncausation is challenging. People who are more inclined to use \nproductivity tools like Copilot may also be those who naturally \nexperience higher job satisfaction, creating potential self -selection \nbias. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as managerial support \nor workplace culture could  influence both Copilot usage and job \nsatisfaction.  This study also relied  on self-reported data that \nintroduces the possibility of response bias.  \nStudy on Generative Search Engines and Task Complexity  \n(Siddharth Suri, Scott Counts, Leijie Wang, Chacha Chen, \nMengting Wan, Tara Safavi, Jennifer Neville, Chirag Shah, Ryen \nW. White, Reid Andersen, Georg Buscher, Sathish Manivannan, \nNagu Rangan, and Longqi Yang ) \nMore study details available in The Use of Generative Search \nEngines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks  (Suri et al. 2024) \nSearch is a  common task in real-world workflows . To understand \nhow the use of AI-augmented search differs from traditional search, \nresearchers analyzed 80 ,000 randomly selected, de -identified \nconversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and \ntraditional Bing searches . They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as \u201cTranslation and language learning ,\u201d \u201cCreative \nwriting and editing ,\u201d and \u201cProgramming and scripting.\u201d  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work.

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n2 \n The goal of th is report is to synthesize learnings from studies from \naround the company versus to completely describe each individual \nstudy. Many of the studies are or will be the subject of dedicated \nreports or research papers , and we have provided links to those \ndocuments where they are already available. Most of the studies \nhave not yet been through peer review and as such they have not \nhad the chance thus far to incorporate external reviewer feedback. \nFurther, before continuing , it is important to acknowledge that all \nwork here was funded by Microsoft, which has a commercial \ninterest in improving and demonstrating the degree to which \nCopilot increases worker productivity.  \n2 RELATED WORK  \nResearchers outside of Microsoft also have been moving to study \ngenerative AI \u2019s impact on productivity in real-world contexts. This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI\u2019s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people\u2019s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations. For example, for the question \"Using Copilot in Teams \nallows me to attend fewer meetings,\" those using Copilot for 3 -6  \nFigure 2. Variable importance in predicting AI power usage  \nGenerative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n5 \n weeks had an average response of 2.66 ( variance 0.81) and those \nwith more than 10 weeks of usage had an average of 3.06 ( variance \n1.34). For the question \u201cUsing Copilot helps me to enjoy my work \nmore\u201d the average for the 3 -6 week group was 3.4 and for the over \n10-weeks group it was 3.6.  All results reported in this analysis are \nstatistically significant, as confirmed by ANOVA tests (p < 0.05).  \n \nIt is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this self-reported \ndata. While  researchers  found significant associations, establishing \ncausation is challenging. People who are more inclined to use \nproductivity tools like Copilot may also be those who naturally \nexperience higher job satisfaction, creating potential self -selection \nbias. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as managerial support \nor workplace culture could  influence both Copilot usage and job \nsatisfaction.  This study also relied  on self-reported data that \nintroduces the possibility of response bias.  \nStudy on Generative Search Engines and Task Complexity  \n(Siddharth Suri, Scott Counts, Leijie Wang, Chacha Chen, \nMengting Wan, Tara Safavi, Jennifer Neville, Chirag Shah, Ryen \nW. White, Reid Andersen, Georg Buscher, Sathish Manivannan, \nNagu Rangan, and Longqi Yang ) \nMore study details available in The Use of Generative Search \nEngines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks  (Suri et al. 2024) \nSearch is a  common task in real-world workflows . To understand \nhow the use of AI-augmented search differs from traditional search, \nresearchers analyzed 80 ,000 randomly selected, de -identified \nconversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and \ntraditional Bing searches . They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as \u201cTranslation and language learning ,\u201d \u201cCreative \nwriting and editing ,\u201d and \u201cProgramming and scripting.\u201d  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations. For example, for the question \"Using Copilot in Teams \nallows me to attend fewer meetings,\" those using Copilot for 3 -6  \nFigure 2. Variable importance in predicting AI power usage  \nGenerative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n5 \n weeks had an average response of 2.66 ( variance 0.81) and those \nwith more than 10 weeks of usage had an average of 3.06 ( variance \n1.34). For the question \u201cUsing Copilot helps me to enjoy my work \nmore\u201d the average for the 3 -6 week group was 3.4 and for the over \n10-weeks group it was 3.6.  All results reported in this analysis are \nstatistically significant, as confirmed by ANOVA tests (p < 0.05).  \n \nIt is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this self-reported \ndata. While  researchers  found significant associations, establishing \ncausation is challenging. People who are more inclined to use \nproductivity tools like Copilot may also be those who naturally \nexperience higher job satisfaction, creating potential self -selection \nbias. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as managerial support \nor workplace culture could  influence both Copilot usage and job \nsatisfaction.  This study also relied  on self-reported data that \nintroduces the possibility of response bias.  \nStudy on Generative Search Engines and Task Complexity  \n(Siddharth Suri, Scott Counts, Leijie Wang, Chacha Chen, \nMengting Wan, Tara Safavi, Jennifer Neville, Chirag Shah, Ryen \nW. White, Reid Andersen, Georg Buscher, Sathish Manivannan, \nNagu Rangan, and Longqi Yang ) \nMore study details available in The Use of Generative Search \nEngines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks  (Suri et al. 2024) \nSearch is a  common task in real-world workflows . To understand \nhow the use of AI-augmented search differs from traditional search, \nresearchers analyzed 80 ,000 randomly selected, de -identified \nconversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and \ntraditional Bing searches . They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as \u201cTranslation and language learning ,\u201d \u201cCreative \nwriting and editing ,\u201d and \u201cProgramming and scripting.\u201d  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst.

There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations. For example, for the question \"Using Copilot in Teams \nallows me to attend fewer meetings,\" those using Copilot for 3 -6  \nFigure 2. Variable importance in predicting AI power usage  \nGenerative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n5 \n weeks had an average response of 2.66 ( variance 0.81) and those \nwith more than 10 weeks of usage had an average of 3.06 ( variance \n1.34). For the question \u201cUsing Copilot helps me to enjoy my work \nmore\u201d the average for the 3 -6 week group was 3.4 and for the over \n10-weeks group it was 3.6.  All results reported in this analysis are \nstatistically significant, as confirmed by ANOVA tests (p < 0.05).  \n \nIt is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this self-reported \ndata. While  researchers  found significant associations, establishing \ncausation is challenging. People who are more inclined to use \nproductivity tools like Copilot may also be those who naturally \nexperience higher job satisfaction, creating potential self -selection \nbias. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as managerial support \nor workplace culture could  influence both Copilot usage and job \nsatisfaction.  This study also relied  on self-reported data that \nintroduces the possibility of response bias.  \nStudy on Generative Search Engines and Task Complexity  \n(Siddharth Suri, Scott Counts, Leijie Wang, Chacha Chen, \nMengting Wan, Tara Safavi, Jennifer Neville, Chirag Shah, Ryen \nW. White, Reid Andersen, Georg Buscher, Sathish Manivannan, \nNagu Rangan, and Longqi Yang ) \nMore study details available in The Use of Generative Search \nEngines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks  (Suri et al. 2024) \nSearch is a  common task in real-world workflows . To understand \nhow the use of AI-augmented search differs from traditional search, \nresearchers analyzed 80 ,000 randomly selected, de -identified \nconversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and \ntraditional Bing searches . They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as \u201cTranslation and language learning ,\u201d \u201cCreative \nwriting and editing ,\u201d and \u201cProgramming and scripting.\u201d  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n2 \n The goal of th is report is to synthesize learnings from studies from \naround the company versus to completely describe each individual \nstudy. Many of the studies are or will be the subject of dedicated \nreports or research papers , and we have provided links to those \ndocuments where they are already available. Most of the studies \nhave not yet been through peer review and as such they have not \nhad the chance thus far to incorporate external reviewer feedback. \nFurther, before continuing , it is important to acknowledge that all \nwork here was funded by Microsoft, which has a commercial \ninterest in improving and demonstrating the degree to which \nCopilot increases worker productivity.  \n2 RELATED WORK  \nResearchers outside of Microsoft also have been moving to study \ngenerative AI \u2019s impact on productivity in real-world contexts. This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI\u2019s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people\u2019s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI\u2019s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people\u2019s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization. The report explores these variations and \nunderscores the potential for AI to h ave even greater impact as \nindividuals and organizations recalibrate their work practices to \nharness AI in the places where it provides the most value . \n \nPlease cite this report as:  \nJaffe, S., Shah, N.P., Butler, J., Farach, A., Cambon, A., Hecht, B., \nSchwarz, M. and Teevan, J. eds. 2024. Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so \u201cusers must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.\u201d  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users\u2019 \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user\u2019s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users\u2019 metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n\u2018answer\u2019 with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI\u2019s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI\u2019s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains for an even wider array of people.   \nREFERENCES  \nAhuja, K., Diddee, H., Hada, R., Ochieng, M., Ramesh, K., Jain, P., Nambi, A., Ganu, \nT., Segal, S., Axmed, M., Bali, K. & Sitaram, S.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights . Given AI \u2019s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect . Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker\u2019s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people\u2019s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024\n######################\nOutput:"}}

All results reported in this analysis are \nstatistically significant, as confirmed by ANOVA tests (p < 0.05).  \n \nIt is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this self-reported \ndata. While  researchers  found significant associations, establishing \ncausation is challenging. People who are more inclined to use \nproductivity tools like Copilot may also be those who naturally \nexperience higher job satisfaction, creating potential self -selection \nbias. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as managerial support \nor workplace culture could  influence both Copilot usage and job \nsatisfaction.  This study also relied  on self-reported data that \nintroduces the possibility of response bias.  \nStudy on Generative Search Engines and Task Complexity  \n(Siddharth Suri, Scott Counts, Leijie Wang, Chacha Chen, \nMengting Wan, Tara Safavi, Jennifer Neville, Chirag Shah, Ryen \nW. White, Reid Andersen, Georg Buscher, Sathish Manivannan, \nNagu Rangan, and Longqi Yang ) \nMore study details available in The Use of Generative Search \nEngines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks  (Suri et al. 2024) \nSearch is a  common task in real-world workflows . To understand \nhow the use of AI-augmented search differs from traditional search, \nresearchers analyzed 80 ,000 randomly selected, de -identified \nconversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and \ntraditional Bing searches . They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as \u201cTranslation and language learning ,\u201d \u201cCreative \nwriting and editing ,\u201d and \u201cProgramming and scripting.\u201d  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Additionally, unmeasured factors such as managerial support \nor workplace culture could  influence both Copilot usage and job \nsatisfaction.  This study also relied  on self-reported data that \nintroduces the possibility of response bias.  \nStudy on Generative Search Engines and Task Complexity  \n(Siddharth Suri, Scott Counts, Leijie Wang, Chacha Chen, \nMengting Wan, Tara Safavi, Jennifer Neville, Chirag Shah, Ryen \nW. White, Reid Andersen, Georg Buscher, Sathish Manivannan, \nNagu Rangan, and Longqi Yang ) \nMore study details available in The Use of Generative Search \nEngines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks  (Suri et al. 2024) \nSearch is a  common task in real-world workflows . To understand \nhow the use of AI-augmented search differs from traditional search, \nresearchers analyzed 80 ,000 randomly selected, de -identified \nconversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and \ntraditional Bing searches . They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as \u201cTranslation and language learning ,\u201d \u201cCreative \nwriting and editing ,\u201d and \u201cProgramming and scripting.\u201d  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl\u2019s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for \u201cRemember\u201d tasks. \nGrouping \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cUnderstand \u201d as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith \u2013 and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with the finding in the Work Trend Index report that \nmany employees were using generative AI tools not provided by \ntheir companies in their work.   \nSpecific Roles and Functions  \nIn addition to the studies above, which span across a range of \nknowledge workers,  some studies also look at how results differ \nacross roles and study generative AI tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia"}}

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.

Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson)  \nOne study asked about and tried to measure metacognitive load \ndirectly. In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants\u2019 \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants\u2019 ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes. Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI\u2019s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people\u2019s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI\u2019s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI\u2019s use in  the context of real workflows, we see \nthat context matters a lot. We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual\u2019s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI\u2019s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals\u2019 personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly .

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \u201cIf this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people\u2019s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell\u2019Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results \u2013 including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces \u2013 point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n\u2022 Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n\u2022 As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.

Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n2 \n The goal of th is report is to synthesize learnings from studies from \naround the company versus to completely describe each individual \nstudy. Many of the studies are or will be the subject of dedicated \nreports or research papers , and we have provided links to those \ndocuments where they are already available. Most of the studies \nhave not yet been through peer review and as such they have not \nhad the chance thus far to incorporate external reviewer feedback. \nFurther, before continuing , it is important to acknowledge that all \nwork here was funded by Microsoft, which has a commercial \ninterest in improving and demonstrating the degree to which \nCopilot increases worker productivity.  \n2 RELATED WORK  \nResearchers outside of Microsoft also have been moving to study \ngenerative AI \u2019s impact on productivity in real-world contexts. This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI\u2019s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people\u2019s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large\n######################\nOutput:"}}

complex than observed in lab studies.   \n\u2022 Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n\u2022 Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI\u2019s impact. \n\u2022 Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n2 \n The goal of th is report is to synthesize learnings from studies from \naround the company versus to completely describe each individual \nstudy. Many of the studies are or will be the subject of dedicated \nreports or research papers , and we have provided links to those \ndocuments where they are already available. Most of the studies \nhave not yet been through peer review and as such they have not \nhad the chance thus far to incorporate external reviewer feedback. \nFurther, before continuing , it is important to acknowledge that all \nwork here was funded by Microsoft, which has a commercial \ninterest in improving and demonstrating the degree to which \nCopilot increases worker productivity.  \n2 RELATED WORK  \nResearchers outside of Microsoft also have been moving to study \ngenerative AI \u2019s impact on productivity in real-world contexts. This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI\u2019s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people\u2019s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs\u2019 business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market. They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as \u201cmaintenance solutions\u201d than for those categorized \nas \u201cnew code development ,\u201d which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a \u201cparadox of reuse\u201d dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large"}}

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, \nViktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, \nAbigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel)  \nMore details available in The Metacognitive Demands and \nOpportunities of Generative AI  (Tankelevitch , Kewenig  et al. 2024)  \nMetacognitive demand \u2014the effort needed for monitoring and \ncontrolling of one\u2019s thoughts and processes \u2014is a part of cognitive \nload, the total amount of mental effort exerted during tasks. In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance.

Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5% accuracy, slightly more accurate than people listening to a \nmeeting in their native Japanese using standard tools (94.8%). This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers\u2019 interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023).

In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one\u2019s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \u201cIf this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey. This 20 -minute, anonymous survey was \nadministered by Edelman Data & Intelligence to 31,000 full -time \nemployed or sel f-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries  \nFigure 1. Effects across organizations of access to Copilot for \nM365 on emails read, scheduled meetings attended, and files \nedited in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint .  \n Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n4 \n between February 15, 2024, and March 28, 2024. The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.  This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is \u201cAI Power Users ,\u201d which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n\u2022 Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n\u2022 Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n\u2022 Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above \nresults through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. \nWhile the analysis reveals significant associations, causation \ncannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature \nof the data. Similarly, s elf-selection bias, response bias, and \nunmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and \nmanagerial support could influence the outcomes.  \nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon , Alex \nFarach, Margarita Bermejo -Cano, and Eric Knudsen ) \nMore study findings available in AI Data Drop: The 11 by 11 \nTipping Point  \nWhile the Work Trend Index survey described above focused on \ngenerative AI in general , researchers also conducted  a broad survey \nfocused specifically on Copilot for Microsoft 365, asking enterprise \nCopilot users  about their  perceived benefits, time savings, and \noverall job satisfaction.  This 20-minute, anonymous survey , which \nis ongoing, is being distributed to people with Copilot licenses at \nparticipating customer organizations from October 1, 2023, to \nNovember 1, 2024. Analysis here is based on 885 responses \ncollected up to February 1, 2024 , from people  who had used \nCopilot for more than three weeks  at the time of survey response . \n  \nThe survey results suggest that people who use d Copilot for an \nextended period receive significant benefits from doing so. \nResearchers analyzed three distinct categories of usage durations: \n3-6 weeks, 7 -10 weeks, and more than 10 weeks. The analysis \nemployed a 5 -point Likert scale, where 1 represents \" Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 represents \"Strongly Agree.\"  \n \nRespondents who had been using Copilot for more than 10 weeks \nreported greater benefits compared to those with shorter usage \ndurations.

Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked\n######################\nOutput:"}}

security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we \u2019re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity Professionals  (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho)  \nMore details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for \nMicrosoft Copilot for Security  (Edelman et al. 2024)  \nLooking at Copilot in the context of another role, security,  \nresearchers extended the lab experiments reported in the first AI \nand Productivity Report studying Copilot for Security  from security \nnovices to security professionals . Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft\u2019s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a \u201clicensing \nchatbot,\u201d trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft\u2019s \nlicensing policies , facilitated sellers\u2019 ability to answer customer \nquestions. The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked"}}

Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

tools developed for use  cases \nof a specific role or profession. Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency . In contrast, those in roles involving more variable \nand/or complex tasks not yet fully optimized by current AI \ncapabilities, including legal and R&D, reported fewer benefits.  \nSome distinctions also may be attributed to highly regulated \nindustries or sensitive use cases . It is likely, however, that  AI tools \nwill be improved  over time to support these scenarios.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n6 \n Specifically , when asked about increased productivity with Copilot \n(\u201cWhen using Copilot I am more productive \u201d with 1=\"Strongly \nDisagree\" and 5 =\"Strongly Agree\" ), the reported effect was highest \namong professionals in customer service and sales ( mean of 4.2 and \n3.97, respectively), and lowest among legal professionals ( mean of \n3.0). For fulfillment (\u201cWhen using Copilot I feel more fulfilled in \nmy work\u201d) customer service and sales functions reported the \nhighest mean agreement (3.53 and 3.41, respectively) with R&D \nand legal functions experiencing the lowest mean agreement (2.74 \nand 2.90, respectively).  Additionally, c ustomer service and product \ndevelopment professionals rated the improvement in work quali ty \n(\u201cUsing Copilot helps improve the quality of my work\u201d) highest, \nwith mean scores of 4.2 0 and 3.93, respectively. In contrast, legal \nprofessionals again reported lower improvement scores, averaging \n3.19.  \n \nIn terms of efficiency and information management, customer \nservice, creative, and sales professionals reported significant ease \nin catching up on missed meetings and retrieving necessary \ninformation, with mean response scores of 4.27, 4.4 0, and 4.45, \nrespectively. Again, legal and operations functions had the lowest \nmean scores for meeting efficiency at 3.28 and 3.75, respectively.  \n \nAs noted above, this study  shares the limits of all surveys in relying \non self-reports. Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction,"}}

Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI\u2019s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers \u2019 trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers \u2019 problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers\u2019 \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople\u2019s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents\u2019 confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft\u2019s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights .
