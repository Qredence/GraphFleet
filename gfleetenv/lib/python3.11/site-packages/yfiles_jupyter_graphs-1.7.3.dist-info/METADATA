[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/yfiles-jupyter-graphs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/yfiles-jupyter-graphs)

A graph diagram visualization widget for Jupyter Notebooks and Labs powered by [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/yfiles-overview?utm_campaign=yfiles4jupyter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme).

Easily visualize graphs from various sources: [Networkx](https://networkx.org/)✅, [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/)✅, [neo4j](https://pypi.org/project/neo4j/)✅, [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/)✅, and any structured Python dictionaries and lists. Many more formats supported indirectly via [Networkx imports](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/index.html#reading-and-writing-graphs)!

The widget is supported in the default Jupyter environments, but also in other environments like VS Code or Google Colab.

[![yFiles Graphs for Jupyter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs/main/screenshots/yfiles-jupyter-graphs.gif)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/715615671)

Try the [Introduction](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs/blob/main/examples/01_introduction.ipynb) notebook on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs/blob/main/examples/01_introduction.ipynb).

## Supported Environments
- [JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Google Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)
- [Google Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)
- [Azure Machine Learning Studio Notebooks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/)
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
- Just try it in your preferred platform for Jupyter notebooks

## Requirements
- [python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.6
- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) notebook or lab
- [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) >= 7.6.0

## Installation

If you already have Jupyter installed, just `pip install` the prebuilt extension from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).

```bash
pip install yfiles_jupyter_graphs
```

If you want to start clean and get a fresh new Jupyter Lab with the widget readily installed and available, you can use [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/), too:

Form a shell, create a docker image that contains all that is required:

```bash
mkdir yfiles-jupyter && cd yfiles-jupyter
echo -e "FROM jupyter/scipy-notebook\nRUN pip install yfiles-jupyter-graphs" > Dockerfile
docker build -t yfiles-jupyter-graphs-on-docker .
```

(the above has been tested successfully with `scipy-notebook:lab-3.4.7` and `yfiles-jupyter-graphs==1.2.1`), but we want to make sure that it will also work with  upcoming versions - file an issue if it doesn't work for you!)

You can then create a fresh new instance of your server from this image like so:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 --name yfiles-jupyter yfiles-jupyter-graphs-on-docker
```

## Usage

In a notebook which has the wiget installed in the server, in a Python cell, you can then do this:

```python
"""Execute in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab"""
from yfiles_jupyter_graphs import GraphWidget
# shows empty widget
GraphWidget()
```

You can find the full documentation [here](https://yworks.github.io/yfiles-jupyter-graphs/).
