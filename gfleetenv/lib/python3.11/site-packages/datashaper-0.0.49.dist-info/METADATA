# datashaper

This project provides a collection of utilities for doing lightweight data wrangling.

There are two goals of the project:

1. Create a shareable client/server schema for serialized wrangling instructions
2. Maintain an implementation of a basic wrangling engine (based on Arquero) and in the case of python implemented in Pandas

# Building

- You need to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) python package manager.
- Run: `poetry install`

# Usage

This project is intended to be used as a library for lightweight data wrangling. In the examples folder there is a [Notebook](examples/examples.ipynb) which provides several examples of how to create data wrangling pipelines and how to read json specifications that can be generated by the js implementation.

Example of joining two tables:

```python
from datashaper.pipeline import Pipeline
import datashaper.types as types
import pandas as pd

# id   name
# 1    bob
# 2    joe
# 3    jane
parents = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3],
    "name": ['bob', 'joe', 'jane']
})

# id   kid
# 1    billy
# 1    jill
# 2    kaden
# 2    kyle
# 3    moe
kids = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3],
    "kid": ['billy', 'jill', 'kaden', 'kyle', 'moe']
})

pipeline = Pipeline()

pipeline.add_dataset('parents', parents)
pipeline.add_dataset('kids', kids)

pipeline.add(Step(
    verb=Verb.join,
    input="parents",
    output="output",
    args={
        "other": "kids",
        "on":["id"]
    }
))

# id   name    kid
# 1    bob     billy
# 1    bob     jill
# 2    joe     kaden
# 2    joe     kyle
# 3    jane    moe
result = pipeline.run()
```
