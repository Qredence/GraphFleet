Notably, our agents improve accuracy by 25.9%and13.2%on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)\nand GSM-Hard (Gao et al., 2023), respectively, compared to the baselines. More surprisingly, we\nobserve that agents discovered in the math domain can be transferred to non-math domains (Table 4).\nWhile the performance of agents originally searched in the math domain does not fully match that of\nagents specifically designed for the target domains, they still outperform (in Reading Comprehension\nand Multi-task) or match (in Science) the state-of-the-art hand-designed agent baselines.

Important building blocks for agentic systems includes: prompting techniques (Chen\net al., 2023a; Schulhoff et al., 2024), chain-of-thought-based planning and reasoning methods (Hu\n& Clune, 2024; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023), reflection (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al.,\n2023), developing new skills for embodied agents in code (Vemprala et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a),\nexternal memory and RAG (Lewis et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2024c), tool use (Nakano et al., 2021;\nQu et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2023), assigning FM modules in the agentic system with different\nroles and enabling them to collaborate (Hong et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023, 2024; Wu et al., 2023;\nXu et al., 2023), and enabling the agent to instruct itself for the next action (Richards, 2023), etc.\nWhile the community has invested substantial effort in developing all the above important techniques,\nthis is only a partial list of the discovered building blocks, and many more remain to be uncovered.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a new research area, ADAS, which aims to invent novel building\nblocks and design powerful agentic systems in an automated manner.\nAI-Generating Algorithms and AutoML.

Following the lessons learned from the history of machine\nlearning, research in AI-Generating Algorithms (AI-GAs) (Clune, 2019) and AutoML (Hutter et al.,\n2019) continually strives to learn more components in AI systems to replace handcrafted ones. There\nare mainly three pillars in this field: (1) meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning\nalgorithms, and (3) generating effective learning environments and training data (Clune, 2019). For\nexample, Neural Architecture Search (Elsken et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2019) aims to\nautomate the design of neural network architectures like convolution, which falls under the first pillar.\nThe second pillar includes works like MAML (Finn et al., 2017) and Meta-RL (Duan et al., 2017;\nNorman & Clune, 2023; Wang et al., 2016; Zintgraf et al., 2021a,b), which allow “learning to learn”\nfor better sample efficiency, generalizability, and continuous learning of multiple tasks. Additionally,\nworks like POET (Dharna et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019, 2020) and OMNI-EPIC (Faldor et al., 2024)\nunder the third pillar aim to generate learning environments in an open-ended manner. We believe\n10Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nAgent NameAccuracy (%) F1 Score Accuracy (%)\nMath Reading Comprehension Multi-task Science\nManually Designed Agents\nChain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) 28.0±3.1 64.2±0.9 65 .4±3.3 29 .2±3.1\nCOT-SC (Wang et al., 2023b) 28.2±3.1 64.4±0.8 65.9±3.230.5±3.2\nSelf-Refine (Madaan et al., 2024) 27.5±3.1 59.2±0.9 63 .5±3.431.6±3.2\nLLM Debate (Du et al., 2023) 39.0±3.4 60.6±0.9 65 .6±3.3 31 .4±3.2\nStep-back Abstraction (Zheng et al., 2023) 31.1±3.2 60.4±1.0 65 .1±3.3 26 .9±3.0\nQuality-Diversity (Lu et al., 2024c) 23.8±3.0 61.8±0.9 65 .1±3.1 30 .2±3.1\nRole Assignment (Xu et al., 2023) 30.1±3.2 65.8±0.9 64.5±3.3 31 .1±3.1\nTop Agents Searched on Math (MGSM) Transferred beyond Math Domains\nDynamic Role-Playing Architecture 53.4±3.5 70.4±0.9 62 .4±3.4 28 .6±3.1\nStructured Multimodal Feedback Loop 50.2±3.5 70.4±0.9 67.0±3.228.7±3.1\nInteractive Multimodal Feedback Loop 47.4±3.5 71.9±0.8 64.8±3.329.9±3.2\nTable 4|Performance across multiple domains when transferring top agents from the Math\n(MGSM) domain to non-math domains. Agents discovered by Meta Agent Search in the math\ndomain can outperform or match the performance of baselines after being transferred to domains\nbeyond math. We report the test accuracy and the 95% bootstrap confidence interval.\nthat the proposed Automated Design of Agentic Systems belongs to both the first and second pillars:\nPillar one because ADAS meta-learns the architecture of agentic systems, but also Pillar two because\nagents are proficient in in-context learning, thus ADAS can also be considered as learning to learn, as\ndemonstrated in the ARC challenge (Section 4.1).\nAdditionally, recent AI-GA and AutoML works have incorporated Foundation Models (FMs) to\nwrite code. For example, in FunSearch (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024) and EoH (Liu et al., 2024),\nFMs write code to discover better optimization algorithms. In DiscoPOP (Lu et al., 2024a), FMs\nprogram the loss function for preference learning in FM alignment training (Rafailov et al., 2024).\nAdditionally, Eureka (Ma et al., 2023) and language-to-reward (Yu et al., 2023) enable FMs to write\nreward functions for reinforcement learning in robotics. Finally, OMNI-EPIC (Faldor et al., 2024)\nenables FMs to create robotics learning environments by programming in code\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

Works like\nOPRO (Yang et al., 2024), PromptBreeder (Fernando et al., 2024), and Self-Discover (Zhou et al.,\n2024a) adopt FMs to automate prompt engineering for agents, primarily focusing on the phrasing of\ninstructions in the prompt to enhance the reasoning capability of agents. Thus, the learned prompts\nare domain-specific and difficult to generalize. Beyond instructions, works like EvoAgent (Yuan\net al., 2024) and AgentVerse (Chen et al., 2023b) optimize role definition in the prompt, as assigning\npersonas or roles to agents has been shown to be beneficial (Xu et al., 2023). Although tuning prompts\neffectively improves performance, other important components in agentic systems remain fixed and\nhand-designed, vastly limiting the space of agents that can be discovered.\nThere are far fewer attempts in the second category, which involves learning more components\nthan just prompts in agentic systems. Most represent agents as networks or graphs in the search\nspace. In these formulations, the FM with a certain prompt is considered a transformation function\nfor text on nodes, and the information flow of the text is considered as edges. DyLAN (Liu et al.,\n11Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n2023) starts with a fully connected feed-forward network and uses FMs to score the response quality\nof nodes in each layer to prune the connections. DSPy (Khattab et al., 2024) first generates a set\nof possible nodes and then optimizes across the Cartesian product of these nodes while optimizing\nthe few-shot examples for nodes. GPT-Swarm (Zhuge et al., 2024) represents an agentic system in\na graph with a predefined set of nodes and uses a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to optimize\nthe possible connections between nodes while optimizing the prompt for each node in a separate\nstage. Although these works allow the learning of control flow (optimizing edges in networks or\ngraphs), many other components, such as whether and which tools to learn or even how many nodes\nto have, are still not learned, greatly limiting the space of agents that can be discovered. Besides\nlearning prompts and control flow, AgentOptimizer (Zhang et al., 2024b) learns the tools used in\nagents, and Agent Symbolic Learning (Zhou et al., 2024b) learns prompts, tools, and control flow\ntogether. While Agent Symbolic Learning shares similar motivations to learn more components in\nagents, it manually designs the search space for each component separately, which may make it a\nharder search space for search algorithms. In addition, it mainly improves agents based on an existing\ncomplex agent, without showing the emergence of new design patterns or building blocks. In contrast,\nour work represents all possible components in code, allowing the search to be easier by leveraging\nhuman efforts in the existing codebase of agents and FMs’ expertise in coding. We also demonstrate\nhow novel and diverse building blocks and design patterns emerge from a set of basic agent designs,\nillustrating the potential creativity that can emerge from ADAS.\n6. Discussion and Conclusion\nSafety Considerations. We strongly advise researchers to be aware of the safety concerns\nwhen executing untrusted model-generated code in Meta Agent Search and other research\ninvolvingcodegeneration. While it is highly unlikely that model-generated code will perform overtly\nmaliciousactionsinourcurrentsettingsandwiththeFoundationModels(FMs)weuse, suchcodemay\nstill act destructively due to limitations in model capability or alignment (Chen et al., 2021; Rokon\net al., 2020). Ideally, sandbox environments can be used to safely run untrusted model-generated\ncode (Chen et al., 2021; Yee et al., 2010).\nMore broadly, research on more powerful AI systems raises the question of whether we should\nbe conducting research to advance AI capabilities at all. That topic clearly includes the proposed\nAutomatedDesignofAgenticSystems(ADAS)asanewareainAI-GAresearch, whichcouldpotentially\ncontribute to an even faster way to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) than the current manual\napproach (Clune, 2019). The question of whether and why we should pursue AGI and AI-GA has\nbeen discussed in many papers (Bengio et al., 2024; Bostrom, 2002; Clune, 2019; Ecoffet et al., 2020;\nYudkowsky et al., 2008), and is beyond the scope of this paper. Specifically as regards ADAS, we\nbelieve it is net beneficial to publish this work. First, this work demonstrates that with the available\nAPI access to powerful FMs, it is easy to program powerful ADAS algorithms, and do so without any\nexp\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

First, this work demonstrates that with the available\nAPI access to powerful FMs, it is easy to program powerful ADAS algorithms, and do so without any\nexpensive hardware like GPUs. We feel it is beneficial to let the community know such algorithms are\npowerful and easy to create, so they can be informed and account for them. Moreover, by sharing this\ninformation, we hope to motivate follow-up work into safe-ADAS, such as algorithms that conduct\nADAS safely during both search itself (e.g. not risking running any harmful code) and that refuse\nto create dishonest, unhelpful, and/or harmful agents. Such an open-source research approach to\ncreate safe-ADAS could be a better way to create safer AI systems (Caldwell, 2011; Meta, 2024). One\ndirection we find particularly promising is to simply ask the Meta Agent Search algorithm to be safe\nduring training and only create helpful, harmless, honest agents, potentially incorporating ideas such\nas Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022).\n12Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nFuture Work. Our work also opens up many future research directions. For example:\n•Higher-order ADAS. Since the meta agent used in ADAS to program new agents in code is also\nan agent, ADAS can become self-referential where the meta agent can be improved through ADAS\nas well. It would be an exciting direction to have a higher order of meta-learning to allow the\nlearning of the meta agent and even the meta-meta agent, etc. (Lu et al., 2023)\n•Seeding ADAS with more existing building blocks. Although we can theoretically allow any\ncomponents in agentic systems to be programmed from scratch in the code space, it is not efficient\nin practice. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore ADAS by standing on the shoulders of\nexisting human efforts, such as search engine tools, RAG (Lewis et al., 2020), or functions from\nexisting agent frameworks like LangChain (LangChainAI, 2022). Additionally, it is interesting\nto support multi-modal capabilities (e.g. vision) in FMs or allow different FMs to be available in\nagentic systems. This will enable the meta agent to choose from different FMs flexibly according to\nthe difficulty of the instruction and whether data privacy is a priority.\n•Multi-objective ADAS. We only consider one objective (i.e., performance) to optimize in this\npaper, but in practice, multiple objectives are often considered, such as cost, latency, and robustness\nof agentic systems (Hu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). Thus, integrating multi-objective search\nalgorithms (Deb et al., 2002) in ADAS could be promising.\n•Novelty search algorithms. In Meta Agent Search, the design of the search algorithm is rel-\natively simple, focusing solely on exploring interesting new designs. A more careful design of\nthe search algorithm can be a promising future direction. For example, one could incorporate\nmore sophisticated ideas from Quality-Diversity (Cully & Demiris, 2017; Mouret & Clune, 2015),\nAI-generating (Clune, 2019), and Open-ended Algorithms (Faldor et al., 2024; Stanley & Lehman,\n2015; Stanley et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024a). One could also include more classic approaches\nto balance exploration and exploitation (Liu et al., 2024; Sutton & Barto, 2018).\n•More intelligent evaluation functions. In this work, we simply evaluate discovered agents on the\nevaluation set and use the numerical performance results. However, this approach is both expensive\nand misses a lot of information. A promising future direction is to enable the meta agent to analyze\ndetailed running logs during the evaluation, which contain rich information on the failure and\nsuccess modes for better debugging and improving agentic systems (Zhou et al., 2024b). Also,\nmany tasks involve subjective answer evaluations (Chiang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024b) that do\nnot have ground-truth answers. It is also important to design novel evaluation functions in ADAS\nto address these tasks. Finally, in this work, we targeted only one domain during the search. It\nwould be interesting to explore whether ADAS algorithms can design even better generalist agents\nwhen specifically searching for agents capable of performing well across multiple domains.\n•More complex domains. Additionally, we only evaluate Meta Agent Search on single-step QA\ntasks in this paper. It would be interesting to extend the method to more complex domians, such\nas real-world applications involving multi-step interaction with complex environments.\n•Understanding the emergence of complexity from human organizations. Beyond potentially\nsaving researchers’ efforts and improving upon the manual design of agentic systems, the research\nin ADAS is also scientifically intriguing as it sheds light on the origins of complexity emerging from\nhuman organization and society. The agentic system is a machine learning system that operates\nprimarily over natural language—a representation that is interpretable to humans and used by\nhumans in constructing our organization and society. Thus, there is a close connection between\nagentic systems and human organizations, as shown in works incorporating the organizational\nstructure for human companies in agents (Hong et al., 2023) or\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

The agentic system is a machine learning system that operates\nprimarily over natural language—a representation that is interpretable to humans and used by\nhumans in constructing our organization and society. Thus, there is a close connection between\nagentic systems and human organizations, as shown in works incorporating the organizational\nstructure for human companies in agents (Hong et al., 2023) or simulating a human town with\nagents (Park et al., 2023). Therefore, the study in ADAS may enable us to observe how to create\na simple set of conditions and have an algorithm to bootstrap itself from simplicity to produce\ncomplexity in a system akin to human society.\n13Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n•Towards a Better Understanding of FMs. Works from Neural Architecture Search (Huang et al.,\n2023) show that by observing the emerged architecture, we could gain more insights into Neural\nNetworks. In this paper, we also gained insights about FMs from the results. For example, the\nbest agent with GPT-3.5 involves a complex feedback mechanism, but when we transfer to other\nadvanced models, the agent with a simpler feedback mechanism but more refinement becomes a\nbetter agent (Section 4.3). This shows that GPT-3.5 may have a worse capability in evaluating and\nrefining the answers, so it needs a complex feedback mechanism for better refinement, while other\nadvanced models benefit more from a simpler feedback mechanism.\nConclusion. Inthispaper, weproposeanewresearchproblem, AutomatedDesignofAgenticSystems\n(ADAS), which aims to automatically invent novel building blocks and design powerful agentic systems .\nWe demonstrated that a promising approach to ADAS is to define agents in code, allowing new agents\nto be automatically discovered by a “meta” agent programming them in code. Following this idea,\nwe propose Meta Agent Search, where the meta agent iteratively builds on previous discoveries\nto program interesting new agents. The experiments show that Meta Agent Search consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art hand-designed agents across an extensive number of domains, and the\ndiscovered agents transfer well across models and domains. Overall, our work illustrates the potential\nof an exciting new research direction toward full automation in developing powerful agentic systems\nfrom the bottom up.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Vector Institute, the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, grants from\nSchmidt Futures and Open Philanthropy, an NSERC Discovery Grant, and a generous donation from\nRafael Cosman.

The agentic system is a machine learning system that operates\nprimarily over natural language—a representation that is interpretable to humans and used by\nhumans in constructing our organization and society. Thus, there is a close connection between\nagentic systems and human organizations, as shown in works incorporating the organizational\nstructure for human companies in agents (Hong et al., 2023) or simulating a human town with\nagents (Park et al., 2023). Therefore, the study in ADAS may enable us to observe how to create\na simple set of conditions and have an algorithm to bootstrap itself from simplicity to produce\ncomplexity in a system akin to human society.\n13Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n•Towards a Better Understanding of FMs. Works from Neural Architecture Search (Huang et al.,\n2023) show that by observing the emerged architecture, we could gain more insights into Neural\nNetworks. In this paper, we also gained insights about FMs from the results. For example, the\nbest agent with GPT-3.5 involves a complex feedback mechanism, but when we transfer to other\nadvanced models, the agent with a simpler feedback mechanism but more refinement becomes a\nbetter agent (Section 4.3). This shows that GPT-3.5 may have a worse capability in evaluating and\nrefining the answers, so it needs a complex feedback mechanism for better refinement, while other\nadvanced models benefit more from a simpler feedback mechanism.\nConclusion. Inthispaper, weproposeanewresearchproblem, AutomatedDesignofAgenticSystems\n(ADAS), which aims to automatically invent novel building blocks and design powerful agentic systems .\nWe demonstrated that a promising approach to ADAS is to define agents in code, allowing new agents\nto be automatically discovered by a “meta” agent programming them in code. Following this idea,\nwe propose Meta Agent Search, where the meta agent iteratively builds on previous discoveries\nto program interesting new agents. The experiments show that Meta Agent Search consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art hand-designed agents across an extensive number of domains, and the\ndiscovered agents transfer well across models and domains. Overall, our work illustrates the potential\nof an exciting new research direction toward full automation in developing powerful agentic systems\nfrom the bottom up.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Vector Institute, the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, grants from\nSchmidt Futures and Open Philanthropy, an NSERC Discovery Grant, and a generous donation from\nRafael Cosman.

Given the input-output grid\nexamples, the AI system is asked to learn the transformation rules and then apply these learned rules\nto the test grid to predict the final answer.\nC. Experiment Details for ARC Challenge\nAn example task from the ARC challenge is shown in Figure 4. In the ARC challenge experiments\n(Section 4.1), we represent the grids as strings of 2-D arrays, where each color is represented by an\ninteger.

Additionally, we provide two tool functions within the framework: (1) to test\nwhetherthegeneratedcodecansolvetheexamplegridsand(2)toobtainthetask’sanswerbyapplying\nthe generated code to the test grid. The accuracy rate is calculated by the Exact Match between the\nreference solution and the predicted answer. The meta agent uses “gpt-4o-2024-05-13” (OpenAI,\n2024), while discovered agents and baselines are evaluated using “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” (OpenAI,\n2022) to reduce compute cost.\nThe domain description of ARC for the meta agent is shown below:\nDescription of ARC for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)\nchallenge.\nIn this challenge, each task consists of three demonstration examples, and one test example. Each\nExample consists of an “input grid” and an “output grid”. Test-takers need to use the transformation rule\nlearned from the examples to predict the output grid for the test example.\n30Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n# An example task from ARC challenge:\n## Task Overview:\nYou will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs grids. The outputs were produced\nby applying a transformation rule to the input grids. In addition to the paired example inputs and\noutputs, there is also one test input without a known output.\nThe inputs and outputs are each “grids”. A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9\n(inclusive). Each number corresponds to a color. 0 is black.\nYour task is to determine the transformation rule from examples and find out the answer, involving\ndetermining the size of the output grid for the test and correctly filling each cell of the grid with the\nappropriate color or number.\nThe transformation only needs to be unambiguous and applicable to the example inputs and the test\ninput. It doesn’t need to work for all possible inputs. Observe the examples carefully, imagine the grid\nvisually, and try to find the pattern.\n## Examples:\n### Example 0:\ninput = [[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,4,4,0,0],\n[0,0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3,5,3,3,3,0], [0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]\noutput = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4], [0,0,4,4], [0,0,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,3,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,0\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

We use the following prompt to instruct and format the output of the meta agent.\nHere, we collect and present some common mistakes that the meta agent may make in the prompt.\nWe found it effective in improving the quality of the generated code.\nOutput Instruction and Example.\n# Output Instruction and Example:\nThe first key should be (“thought”), and it should capture your thought process for designing the\nnext function. In the “thought” section, first reason about what the next interesting agent to try\nshould be, then describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design, and\nfinally detail the implementation steps. The second key (“name”) corresponds to the name of\nyour next agent architecture. Finally, the last key (“code”) corresponds to the exact “forward()”\nfunction in Python code that you would like to try. You must write COMPLETE CODE in “code”:\nYourcodewillbepartoftheentireproject, sopleaseimplementcomplete, reliable, reusablecodesnippets.\n24Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nHere is an example of the output format for the next agent:\n{“thought”: “**Insights:** Your insights on what should be the next interesting agent. **Overall Idea:**\nyour reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design. **Implementation:** describe the\nimplementation step by step.”,\n“name”: “Name of your proposed agent”,\n“code”: “def forward(self, taskInfo): # Your code here”}\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\n[Examplesofpotentialmistakesthemetaagentmaymakeinimplementation]\nAfter the first response from the meta agent, we perform two rounds of self-reflection to make the\ngenerated agent novel and error-free (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023).\nPrompt for self-reflection round 1.\n[GeneratedAgentfromPreviousIteration]\nCarefully review the proposed new architecture and reflect on the following points:\n1. **Interestingness**: Assess whether your proposed architecture is interesting or innovative compared\nto existing methods in the archive. If you determine that the proposed architecture is not interesting,\nsuggest a new architecture that addresses these shortcomings.\n- Make sure to check the difference between the proposed architecture and previous attempts.\n- Compare the proposal and the architectures in the archive CAREFULLY, including their actual differences\nin the implementation.\n- Decide whether the current architecture is innovative.\n- USE CRITICAL THINKING!\n2. **Implementation Mistakes**: Identify any mistakes you may have made in the implementation.\nReview the code carefully, debug any issues you find, and provide a corrected version. REMEMBER\nchecking \"## WRONG Implementation examples\" in the prompt.\n3. **Improvement**: Based on the proposed architecture, suggest improvements in the detailed\nimplementation that could increase its performance or effectiveness. In this step, focus on refining and\noptimizing the existing implementation without altering the overall design framework, except if you\nwant to propose a different architecture if the current is not interesting.\n- Observe carefully about whether the implementation is actually doing what it is supposed to do.\n- Check if there is redundant code or unnecessary steps in the implementation. Replace them with\neffective implementation.\n- Try to avoid the implementation being too similar to the previous agent.\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture\nbased on the reflection.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\n\"reflection\": Provide your thoughts on the interestingness of the architecture, identify any mistakes in the\nimplementation, and suggest improvements.\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same\nformat as the example response.\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don’t put words like \"new\" or \"improved\"\nin the name.)\n\"code\": Provide the corrected code or an improved implementation. Make sure you actually implement\nyour fix and improvement in this code.\n25Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nPrompt for self-reflection round 2.\nUsing the tips in “## WRONG Implementation examples” section, further revise the code.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\nInclude your updated reflections in the “reflection”. Repeat the previous “thought” and “name”. Update\nthe corrected version of the code in the “code” section.\nWhen an error is encountered during the execution of the generated code, we conduct a reflection\nand re-run the code. This process is repeated up to five times if errors persist. Here is the prompt we\nuse to self-reflect any runtime error:\nPrompt for self-reflection when a runtime error occurs.\nError during evaluation:\n[Runtimeerrors]\nCarefully consider where you went wrong in your latest implementation. Using insights from previous\nattempts, try to debug the current code to implement the same thought. Repeat your previous thought in\n“thought”, and put your thinking for debugging in “debug_thought”.\nB. Framework Code\nIn this paper, we provide the meta agent with a simple framework to implement basic functions,\nsuch as querying Foundation Models (FMs) and formatting prompts. The framework consists of\nfewer than 100 lines of code (excluding comments). In this framework, we encapsulate every\npiece of information into a namedtuple Info object, making it easy to combine different types of\ninformation (e.g., FM responses, results from tool function calls, task descriptions) and facilitate\ncommunicationbetweendifferentmodules. Additionally,intheFMmodule,weautomaticallyconstruct\nthe prompt by concatenating all input Info objects into a structured format, with each Info titled by\nits metadata (e.g., name, author). Throughout the appendix, we renamed some variables in the\ncode to match the terminologies used in the main text. The full framework code is available at\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This enables us to create data at scale (benefiting from\nautomation of agentic flows), with high diversity (based on the broad and diverse seeds) and\nof varying complexity (benefiting from the iterative and refinement patterns supported by\nagentic flows). AgentInstruct defines three different flows:\nContent Transformation Flow converts the raw seed into an intermediate representation\nthat simplifies the creation of instructions tailored to specific objectives. It comprises of\n31\nContent Transformation Flow…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...………………\n………………\n………………\n……Raw text \ndocuments or \nsource code \nfiles are used \nas seedsTransformed \ncontent ( e.g.  \nargument passage, \nmeeting transcript, \nlist of APIs,….)\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow\n……Transformed \ncontent provide \ndiversity is easier \nto use to generate \ninstructions Seed instructions \nare generated \nfollowing  a \ncomprehensive \ntaxonomy…...…...…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...\n3\nInstruction Refinement Flow\nIteratively refine the instructions \nto boost quality, diversity and \ncomplexity\n2Figure 3: Figure provides a thematic overview of the roles played by different groups of\nagents. Content Transformation Flow converts the seed into an intermediate representation\nthat makes it easier to create high quality and diverse data. Seed Instruction Generation\nFlow creates instances of the target tasks following a taxonomy. Refinement Flow explores\nthe space further by starting from these initial data points and exploring the neighborhood.\nThe expectation is that by picking a random seed we will be able to cover the entire region\nof data points.\nmultiple agents and is often instrumental in the generation of high-quality data and serve as\nan additional means to introduce diversity.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow comprising of multiple agents takes as input the\ntransformed seed from the Content Transformation Flow and generates a set of diverse\ninstructions. The only goal of the Seed Instruction Flow is to introduce diversity for which\nit often relies on a pre-defined, but extensible, taxonomy.\nInstruction Refinement Flow takes as input the instructions from the Seed Instruction\nFlow and iteratively enhances their complexity and quality. Towards this we use the concept\nof Suggester-Editor Agents[ 19]. Suggester agents initially propose various approaches to\nincrease the intricacy of the initial instructions (making them more complex, unsolvable,\nor tricky), after which the Editor agents modify the instructions in accordance with these\nsuggestions.\nEach flow consists of a number of agents. We use a generic definition of an agent, where an\nagent is powered by an LLM and can optionally have the ability to use tools such as search\nAPIs, code interpreter or a calculator. Each agent has a specific role and set of instructions\nspecified as part of the underlying LLM system message.\nWe implemented these flows for 17 different skills, each having multiple subcategories.\nThe skills include reading comprehension, question answering, coding, retrieval augmented\ngeneration, creative writing, tool/API use and Web control. The full list is provided in\nTable 1\nWe explain how the workflows work with case studies of generating data for the following\nthree skills:\nReading Comprehension: The ability to understand, process, and interpret written text.\nText Modification: The process of altering text to suit different purposes.\nTool Use: The employment of functions or APIs to perform tasks or solve problems.\n4Reading Comprehension: Reading comprehension is a critical skill involving processing and un-\nderstanding text, which is necessary for learning and encompasses decoding, fluency, and vocabulary\nknowledge. Reading comprehension tests typically present text passages of varying lengths and\nsubjects, followed by questions that assess the reader’s understanding.\nOpen Domain Question Answering: Open domain question answering involves generating\nresponses to questions over a wide range of topics, without being restricted to a specific domain.\nText Modification: Text modification involves changing existing text to improve its quality,\nmodify its tone, or to fit a specific context or audience. It is a common task in content creation and\nediting.\nWeb Agent: A web agent is a software program that autonomously performs tasks on the web,\nsuch as where to click, how much to scroll.\nBrain Teaser A brain teaser is a problem or puzzle, typically requiring thought to solve, often for\namusement but also used for training logical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nAnalytical Reasoning Analytical reasoning involves the ability to look at information, be it\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, and discern patterns within the information. It’s a process\nthat includes understanding a system of relationships and draw logical conclusions about those\nrelationships.\nMultiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions are a form of assessment where respondents\nare asked to select the best possible answer (or answers) out of the choices from a list. They are\ncommon in standardized tests, quizzes, and surveys.\nData To Text Data-to-text refers to human-readable textual summaries from source data. These\ncould be used for generating reports, explanations, or narratives from structured data.\nFermiFermi problems are estimation problems which seek quick, rough estimates of quantities\nwhich can be difficult to measure.

Reading comprehension is a very important\ncapability and can enable scenarios like question answering, search, grounded reasoning, etc.\nContent Transformation Flow Web crawls encompass an extensive collection of human-\ngenerated text, which holds potential for generating reading comprehension materials.\nHowever, these sources are not inherently structured to facilitate the teaching of read-\ning comprehension skills. Consequently, they do not support the consistent generation of\ndiverse question types required for comprehensive reading comprehension evaluation. For\ninstance, the LSAT Logical Reasoning test features specialized question categories, including\nassumption, strengthening/weakening, flaw, and inference questions. Crafting such questions\nnecessitates passages with a particular stylistic and logical framework. The objective of\nContent Transformation Flow is to transform arbitrary articles into well-crafted pieces that\nare conducive to the formulation of a wide array of reading comprehension question types.\nOur current flow for Reading Comprehension encompasses a suite of nine content transfor-\nmation agents for generating argument passages, debates and conversations, long passages,\nmeeting transcripts, poems, satarical content, etc. Detailed description is provided in Ap-\npendix A. Given a seed article, the flow will randomly pick one of the Content Transformation\nAgents to assess the seed article and attempt to generate the text passages. The following\nprovides an example for the Argument Passage Generator .\nEXAMPLE: Content Transformation Flow\nRandom Seed\nUric acid is a substance produced naturally by the breakdown of purine (a type of dietary\nprotein). When it is in excess in the body, crystals composed of these substances are formed.\nThese crystals are deposited in various parts of the body, mainly in the joints and kidneys,\ncausing pain and other aggravations. The lack or excess of uric acid in the body is caused by\nsome diseases (such as leukemia, obesity, kidney diseases, and anemia) and factors related\nto lifestyle (consumption of alcohol and processed foods, for example).\nContents\n•Where does purine come from?\n•Where is uric acid found?\n•What is high uric acid?\n•What can high uric acid cause?\n•What is low uric acid?\n•Tests: how to know uric acid levels?\nWhere does purine come from?\nPurine is produced and released into the bloodstream when an amino acid is broken down\nby digestion. Therefore, it is produced naturally in the body. ... (Truncated)\n6Transformed Seed (Argument Passage Generator)\nRecent studies have indicated that high levels of uric acid in the blood, known as hyper-\nuricemia, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Uric acid is a byproduct of purine\nmetabolism, and while it is naturally produced in the body, excessive amounts can lead to\nhealth complications. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as levels above 6 mg/dL in women\nand 7 mg/dL in men. This condition can result from increased production of uric acid or\ninsufficient elimination through urine. Factors contributing to high uric acid include a diet\nrich in purines, found in red meat and seafood, as well as lifestyle choices such as alcohol\nconsumption and physical inactivity. Conversely, low levels of uric acid, or hypouricemia,\nare less common and usually do not present symptoms. Nonetheless, they can be indicative\nof underlying kidney or liver issues. Diagnosing either condition requires laboratory blood\nand urine tests. It is important to note that while high uric acid levels are associated with\nan increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the causal\nOutput:"}}

It is important to note that while high uric acid levels are associated with\nan increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the causal relationship remains to be conclusively\nestablished.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 43\nreading comprehension questions types. The list includes literal comprehension questions,\ncritical comprehension questions, evaluative comprehension questions, reasoning, identifying\nassumptions, identifying information that strengthens/weakens an argument, ordering events,\netc.\nA list some of these types is in Appendix A.\nWe have defined multiple Agents targeting these categories. Each of these agent receives as\ninput a piece of text and generates a list of questions based on a predefined question type.\nThe orchestration process will engage a subset of these agents, determined by the content\ntransformation agent in the preceding step. Upon completion of this phase, we will obtain a\ncollection of (passage, question) pairs that will constitute the input for the subsequent stage.\nThe following figure provides an example of Strengthen type question that is generated from\nthe running example.\nEXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nWhich one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument that high lev-\nels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?\n(A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid levels in the\nblood.\n(C) Dietary supplements have been shown to reduce uric acid levels in the blood.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found to have\nuric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease are more likely to have high\nuric acid levels.\nInstruction Refinement Flow The refinement flow contains multiple suggester-editor\nagents that will go through each of the (passage, question) pairs and create more such pairs\nwith the following goals: (1) Modify the passage to make the question unanswerable, (2)\nModify the passage to alter the answer, if possible, in opposite direction, or (3) Modify the\nquestions or answer choices (if applicable) to make them complex.\nHere is an example where the suggester agent that tries to add a difficult distractor to\nconfuse the test taker.\n7EXAMPLE: Refinement Flow\nSUGGESTER\n•Suggestion 1 Introduce a hypothetical study or finding that could potentially\nstrengthen the argument, requiring the test-taker to infer its impact on the rela-\ntionship between uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease.\n•Suggestion 2 Add a layer of complexity by suggesting a genetic predisposition\nto hyperuricemia and its correlation with increased cardiovascular events, which\nwould require the test-taker to consider both genetic and physiological factors.\n•Suggestion 3 Include a distractor option that seems to strengthen the argument\nbut upon closer examination, it does not directly relate to the causal relationship\nbetween uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease, thus testing the test-taker’s\nability to discern relevant from irrelevant information.\nEDITOR\n•Modification 1,2 (omitted for brevity)\n•Modification 3 Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument\nthat high levels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?\n(A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid\nlevels in the blood.\n(C) A placebo-controlled trial shows that individuals taking uric acid-lowering\nmedication do not exhibit a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease compared\nto the placebo group.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found\nto have uric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) A cross-sectional study finds that high uric acid levels are associated with other\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but does\nnot establish a direct causal link.\n2.2 AgentInstruct Flow for Text Modification\nText modification is the process of editing and refining written content to enhance its quality\nand effectiveness or alter its attributes. This involves correcting spelling and grammar,\nclarifyingideas, reorganizingcontentforbetterflow, adjustingtone, ensuringstyleconsistency,\nfact-checking, removingredundancies, formatting, developingcontent, andadaptingtospecific\naudiences. It is a useful skill for LLMs that help in content writing. While several content\ntransformation agents can be introduced to intentionally modify the text as described earlier,\nwe focus here on showing the how the instructions are created and refined.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 18types\nof text modification tasks including paraphrasing, expansion, simplification, redacting or\nremoving content, styling, code switching, etc. The full list is in Appendix A.\nWe define an Agent for each of the task type. Each agent takes as input a piece of text and\ncreates several text modification tasks of the associated type. Here we provide an example\ninput and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.\n8EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nRandom Seed\nApril 6-8, 2017, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

Here we provide an example\ninput and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.\n8EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nRandom Seed\nApril 6-8, 2017, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA. Abstracts due December 1, 2016.\nFinance is hard to escape. In recent years, the increasing social impact and interconnection\nof financial discourses, markets, actors, and institutions have been understood under the\nbroad concept of financialization. Natascha van der Zwan identifies three distinct research\nstreams that have approached financialization as 1) a regime of accumulation, 2) the influence\nof financial markets and instruments on non-financial corporations as well as the banking\nand finance industry, and 3) a discourse of risk-taking, self-management and self-fulfillment\nthat is transforming people into investing subjects. Some anthropological skeptics, however,\nargue that finance has a far longer genealogy than the financialization literature has to date\nrecognized. For example, in the context of a lengthy human history of creating hierarchy,\nfinancialization may simply be a new technology serving an old purpose.\n... (omitted for brevity)... ·The supply chains of financial products connect different places\nand political projects across the globe. How do such financial instruments transform social\nlife?\nAbstract deadline is December 1, 2016.\n1. Go to americananthro.org and log in. If you don’t have a login id and password, create\none (you do not need to join the American Anthropological Association).\n2. Once you are logged in, look to the left hand column, click on Meeting registration.\n3. Click on register under the SEA 2017 Annual Meeting then follow online prompts to\nregister for the meeting (if we do not accept your abstract and you decide not to attend,\nyou may request that your registration fee be refunded and we would be happy to do so).\n4. Once you are registered, AAA will automatically send you an email inviting you to submit\nan abstract. Click the link and follow the instructions.\nTask:\nRewrite the event details (date, location, abstract deadline) in a more casual tone.\nGiven a random seed, the seed instruction creation flow randomly picks one of the 18agents\nand uses that to obtain a seed (text, text modification instruction) pair.\nInstruction Refinement Flow The refinement flow consists of only one Suggester-Editor\npair. The Suggester-Editor duo increase the complexity of the generated instructions while\ntaking as input the text and the task modification instruction as input. Here we show three\nsuggestions and edits as proposed by the suggester-editor pair.\nEXAMPLE: IRefinement Flow\nSuggestions\nSuggestion 1: Incorporate a fictional narrative. Use a conversational style with colloquial\nlanguage and include a humorous element.\nSuggestion 2: Translate the event details into a poetic format. Maintain accurate infor-\nmation while using rhyming couplets and ensure the tone remains light and\nengaging.\nSuggestion 3: Frame the event details as a social media post. Use internet slang and\nemojis. Keep the message within 280 characters.\nModified Instructions\nInstruction 1: Rewrite the event details (date, location, abstract deadline) as if you’re\ntelling a funny story to a friend using casual and colloquial language,\nwhile incorporating a fictional narrative that still conveys the necessary\ninformation.\nInstruction 2: Transform the event details (date, location, abstract deadline) into a light-\nheartedpoemwithrhymingcouplets, ensuringthattheessentialinformation\nis accurately conveyed in a poetic format.\nInstruction 3: Craft a social media post that includes the event details (date, location,\nabstract deadline) using internet slang, emojis, and a casual tone, while\nkeeping the message concise and within 280 characters.\n92.3 AgentInstruct Flow for Tool Use\nThe task of tool use or API use for LLMs involves enabling models to interact with external\ntools or services; via APIs. This capability allows AI systems to extend their functionality,\naccess external data, and perform actions beyond their native capabilities.\nContent Transformation Flow We use source code snippets or an API description [ 26] as\nthe random seed. If source code snippets has been used as the seed, a content transformation\nagent is used to synthesize an API description from the code snippet. The goal of the\nContent Transformation Flow is to synthesize list of APIs from the random seed. API lists\nare created by either: (1) using an API retrieval agent that iteratively searches for similar\ncode to expand the API list or (2) the agent uses the LLM to hypothesize other APIs present\nin the library.\nThe following figure provides an example of the library reconstruction scenario.\nEXAMPLE: Content Transformation Flow [Library Reconstruction]\nSeed\n{\n\"name\": \"View All Food Items\",\n\"description\": \"The request enables clients to obtain a detailed list of food items,\ncomplete with nutritional profiles such as calorie count, protein, fat, ...\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"limit\": {\n\"type\": \"NUMBER\",\n\"description\": \"limit the length of response\"\n}\n},\n\"required\": []\n}\n}\nReconstructed Remaining APIs from the Library\n[\n{\n\"name\": \"Search Food Items\",\n\"description\": \"Allows clients to search for food items by name and retrieve a list of\nmatching items ...\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"query\": {\n\"type\": \"string\",\n\"description\": \"The name or partial name of the food item to search for.\"\n},\n\"limit\": {\n\"type\": \"number\",\n\"description\": \"Optional parameter to limit the number of search results\nreturned.\"\n\nOutput:"}}

Would you like me to search for ’Chana Masala’ and ’Butter Chicken’?\nUSER:\n...(truncated)\n133 Orca-3\n3.1 Dataset Description\nWe implemented an AgentInstruct Flow for 17 different capabilities as described in Table 1.\nWe created a collection of approximately 22 million instructions aimed at teaching the\naforementioned skills. We have used unstructured text and code files sampled from\nKnowledgePile[ 7], AutoMathText[ 38], a subset of openstax and a subset of apache-2.0\nlicensed source code files from [ 4]. The dataset covers variety of skills, as detailed in Table 1.\nUsing unstructured content as seeds for instruction data generation has several benefits.\nFirst, there is abundance of such data enabling the generation of large-scale and diverse\ninstruction data. Additionally, it enables us to avoid using any benchmark-specific data as\nseeds and hence focus on optimizing for a capability, not for a specific benchmark.\nIn addition to the 22 million instructions, we have incorporated approximately 3.8 million\npaired instructions sourced from Orca-1[ 21], Orca-2[ 18], Orca-Math[ 19] and samples from\nother publicly available sources such as [ 5,37,10,30]. We refer to this data as Orca-2.5-\ndataset.\nThe culmination of these datasets results in approximately 25.8 million paired instructions,\nall of which are incorporated into the training of Orca-3. Furthermore, we have trained a\nseparate model, referred to as Orca-2.5, using the 3.8 million instructions (Orca-2.5-dataset).\nThe purpose of this is to compare and evaluate the impact of the 22 million instructions\ncurated through AgentInstruct.\n3.2 Training Details\nWe use the 25.8 million paired instructions described earlier to finetune Mistral-7b-v0.1.\nWe choose this model because the it makes the weights publicly available for the base\n(no-instruction-tuned) version, with a permissive license allowing easy redistribution. We\nrefer to the finetuned model ( Mistral-7b-v0.1 finetuned on AgentInstruct dataset) as Orca-3.\nEach pair in the dataset undergoes a tokenization process using the Mistral tokenizer,\nensuring a maximum sequence length of 8192 with packing. To guarantee that the training\nloss is calculated based only on the response conditioned on the prompt, label masking is\napplied. Weight decay was set at 0.1\nThe finetuneing used 19 NVIDIA A100 nodes, or 152 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with a\nbatch size of 10. We used AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 8e-6 and a a\ncosine learning rate schedule. We also used a linear learning rate warm-up during the initial\n500 steps. The model was trained for three epochs and the training process concluded after\napproximately 200 hours.\n4 Evaluation Results\n4.1 Orca-Bench\nThe Orca-Bench dataset serves as a held-out test set, consisting of 100 samples from each of\nthe 17 skills for which data was curated using AgentInstruct, except for the Open Domain\nQuestion Answering (ODQA) category, where we created two test sets. The first subset,\nreferred to as ODQA, consists of 100 questions originated from the initial seed instruction\nphase. The second subset, termed Complex ODQA, includes more intricate questions\ndeveloped during the refinement phase.\nWe evaluated the performance of all baselines using the Orca-Bench dataset. These were\nscored relative to GPT-4 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. It is worth noting that some of\nthe entries within Orca-Bench involve multiple exchanges. To illustrate, let a multi-turn\ninteraction in Orca-Bench be denoted by\nOutput:"}}

This ratio is then multiplied by 10 to normalize the student’s\nfinal score to a 0 to 10 scale.\nAgentInstruct’s objective is to synthesize a large and diverse corpus of data with varying\ndegrees of difficulty. An efficacious execution of this strategy should yield a dataset against\nwhich baseline models like Orca-2.5, Mistral-Instruct-7b, and ChatGPT score substantially\nbelow 10, demonstrating their relative inferiority to GPT-4—a model that is designated as\nthe benchmark with a score of 10.

It evaluates\nhow well models perform in answering questions from human-centric standardized\nexams such as SAT, LSAT and math competitions.\n•MMLU : Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [ 9] benchmark\nmeasures a model’s multitask understanding. The benchmark includes approximately\n16000 multiple choice questions covering a wide range of 57 academic subjects such\nas maths, philosphy, medicine, psychology, computer-science, law etc. testing both\ngeneral and specialized knowledge of the model being tested.\n•ARC: The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) [ 2] benchmark, developed by AllenAI,\nmeasures the reasoning, commonsense knowledge and deep comprehension abilities\nof language models. The test set contains 3548 multiple-choice questions that are\ndivided into 2 sets : Easy(2376) and Challenge(1172).\n•BBH: Big Bench Hard [ 31] consists of a set of 23 tasks selected from the broader\nBig-Bench benchmark spanning a wide array of academic subjects requiring complex,\nmulti-step reasoning.\n•GPQA: Graduate-level Google-Proof Q&A [ 27] is a challenging benchmark of 448\nhigh-quality and extremely difficult multiple-choice questions created by domain\nexperts(pursuing PhDs in their domains) in biology, chemistry and physics.\n•DROP: Discrete Reasoning over Paragraphs [ 6] is a Reading Comprehension bench-\nmark requiring the models to resolve references in questions and perform discrete\noperations over them such as sorting, counting, addition etc.\n16•GSM8K : Grade School Math 8K [ 3] is a dataset of high quality diverse grade\nschool math word problems. The test split of the dataset consists of 1.32K problems\nrequiring between 2 and 8 steps to solve primarily involving sequence of elementary\ncalculations using basic arithmetic operations.\n•FoFo: Format Following [ 34] is a benchmark that evaluates a model’s ability to\nfollow complex, domain-specific formats. The benchmark tests format following on\na diverse range of real-world formats and instructions from domains like Healthcare,\nFinance, Marketing etc. created using AI-Human collaboration.\n•IFEval: Instruction-Following Evaluation [ 40] is a benchmark measuring a model’s\nability to follow natural language instructions using a set of 500 prompts covering\n25 types of ’verifiable instructions’ where each prompt can contain one or more of\nthese instructions.\n•MT-Bench : MT-Bench [ 16] benchmark is specifically designed to assess the com-\npetence of chat assistants in multi-turn conversations using GPT-4 as the evaluator.\n•AlpacaEval : AlpacaEval [ 14] is a benchmark specifically designed for chat-based\nlanguage models to assess their abilities in the context of instruction-following tasks.\nIt is a single-turn benchmark consisting of 805 instructions representative of user\ninteractions on Alpaca web demo.\n•InFoBench : The InFoBench [ 25] benchmark evaluates models instruction fol-\nlowing capability using a new metric called Decomposed Requirements Following\nRatio(DRFR). DRFR breaks complex instructions down into simpler criteria and\nfacilitates analysis of an LLM’s compliance to these decomposed tasks in detail.\nThe benchmark has 500 diverse instructions and 2250 decomposed questions across\nmultiple constraint categories.\n•EQBench : This Emotional Intelligence benchmark [ 23] evaluates aspects of emo-\ntional intelligence in language models. It tests models capabilities to comprehend\nintricate emotions and social interactions by providing a conversation between char-\nacters and then asking the model to predict intensity of emotional states of those\ncharacters. The authors discovered a strong correlation (r=0.97) between EQ-Bench\nand comprehensive multi-domain benchmarks like MMLU.\nThe results for all the baselines on each benchmark are given in table 3. All of the evaluations\nfor Orca-3 and other baselines was done in a zero-shot setting unless mentioned otherwise in\nthe text.\nThe types of tasks/benchmarks and the corresponding method used to extract answer and\ngenerate metrics is specified in Appendix B.\n4.3 Evaluation: Reading Comprehension\nReading comprehension is a crucial capability for LLMs. It is arguably even more important\nfor Small Language Models (SLMs), as they are better suited as reasoning engines than mere\nretrieval systems. Through targeted training with AgentInstruct, we observe substantial\nimprovement in Mistral’s reading comprehension capabilities (Table ??)—showcasing an 18%\nimprovement over Orca 2.5 and a 21% gain relative to Mistral-Instruct-7b. Furthermore, by\nleveraging this data-driven approach, we have elevated the performance of a 7B model to\nmatch that of GPT-4 on the reading comprehension sections of the Law School Admission\nTests (LSATs), which are considered difficult for human test-takers.\n4.4 Evaluation: Math\nOutput:"}}

Note: The\nscores for Gemini Pro are taken from the original paper [34]\n4.6 Evaluation: Abstractive Summarization\nSummarization is an important capability for Language Models, with many models achieving\nhigh quality summarization performance, yet struggling with hallucination. We assessed\nsummarization ability using two key metrics: hallucinations and quality. For this purpose,\nwe utilized GPT4 as our evaluator. The prompts utilized in these evaluations can be found\nin Appendix B. We used the following benchmarks for evaluating summarization abilities:\n•ACI-Bench: The Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark (ACI-Bench) [ 32] is a\ndataset designed for benchmarking automatic report generation from doctor-patient\nconversations. The test set comprises 120 data points.\n•InstruSum: A dataset [ 15] for evaluating the generation capabilities LLMs for\ninstruction-controllable summarization. It consists of 100 datapoints.\n•Orca-Sum: A newly created benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ ability to follow summa-\nrization and grounded data transformation instructions. To construct this test set,\nwe sampled data from 45 summarization datasets collected from Hugging Face across\nmultiple domains such as news, conversations, science, health, social, e-mails, code,\netc. for a total of 458 datapoints. We randomly collected, up to 1000 datapoints\nwhich then we carefully deduplicated to avoid overlapping with the training set. We\nthen used GPT-4 to generate a set of 40 prompts for each dataset out of each we\nrandomly sampled one for each selected datapoint. The prompts are dataset-specific\nand focus on summarization, grounding, and data transformation. For instance, a\nprompt may ask the model to generate a TikTok video out of a scientific paper or\na legal contract from a Wikipedia page. This allows us to measure not only the\nquality of the response but also hallucination in a challenging scenario, as the model\nis forced to move between formats and domains.\nThe results are presented in Table 7. With the AgentInstruct approach, we successfully\nachieved a reduction in hallucinations by 31.34%, while attaining a quality level comparable\nto GPT4 (Teacher).\n4.7 Evaluation: RAG\nThe RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) skill significantly boosts the capacity of Lan-\nguage Models to generate informed, contextually precise responses, hence upgrading their\noverall performance and usefulness. It is arguably more effective to test the RAG proficiency\nof language models in areas where the models have limited knowledge. For this study, we\nselected MIRAGE[ 35], a benchmark that focuses on answering medical questions by referring\nto information retrieved from a medical corpus. Since the medical domain is not typically a\nprimary focus of the models evaluated in this study, MIRAGE provides an effective platform\nfor assessing their RAG capabilities. Additionally, AgentInstruct RAG data used generic,\nnon medical data seed, enabling us to test how well can the skill (RAG) be applied to new\ndomains.\n19ModelOrca-3\n-7BOrca-2.5\n-7BMistral-\n7B-InstructLLAMA3-\n8B-instructGPT-3.5-\nturboGPT-4\nHallucination Rate (%) - Smaller is better\nAll (micro) 21.09\n(-26.12%,\n-31.34%)28.55 30.72 34.22 21.13 15.07\nOrca-Sum 28.17 36.84 39.61 38.43 28.60 21.66\nInstruSum 9.00 12.00 17.00 25.00 12.00 1.00\nACI-Bench 4.20 10.83 8.30 25.83 1.70 1.70\nQuality Score (1-10) - Higher is better\nAll (micro) 9.14\n(+7.91%,\n+3.28%)8.47 8.85 9.00 8.69 9.08\nOrca-Sum 8.95 8.27 8.61 8.90 8.32 8.61\nInstruSum 9.17 8.30 9.16 9.21 9.27 9.31\nACI-Bench 9.72 9.39 9.48 9.23 9.60 9.70\nTable 7: Hallucination rates and quality scores evaluated by GPT4.

The figures (x%) adjacent to the Orca-\n3 results signify the percentage of improvement compared to Mistral-7B-Instruct respectively.\nCoT shows the performance of the same models when answering directly without using RAG\nWe use the same retrieval mechanism across all models on MIRAGE [ 35], using MedRAG,\nthe corpus accompanying the benchmark. This involves using the same retrieval function\nand the same number of retrieved documents for all models. As all models are presented\nwith the same set of retrieved documents, the comparison accurately reflects the ability of\ndifferent models to incorporate retrieved results into their responses.\nTable 8 shows the results of all models on MIRAGE with and without leveraging RAG1.\nOverall, we observe that\n•Models with a deeper understanding of the task (CoT scores) tend to have higher\nRAG scores. If we restrict our focus to only RAG performance, applying post-\ntraining, we’ve managed to enhance Mistral’s performance by an average of 38.30%.\n1Results of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo are from [35].\n20•Of the five datasets in MIRAGE, PubMedQA arguably offers the most effective\ntestbed for assessing models ability to do RAG. In PubMedQA, all models have\nlimited prior knowledge, and the retrieved context provides essential information, as\ndemonstrated by GPT4’s performance leap. All Mistral fine-tunes exhibit similar\nperformance, but only Orca-3 (Mistral trained with AgentInstruct RAG flow data)\nshows a substantial improvement, resulting in a relative improvement of 92.71% over\nMistral-Instruct.\n5 Limitations\nAgentInstruct reduces human expertise required for data generation significantly and enables\ncreating of high-quality synthetic data at scale. However, this is till an early step in this\ndirection and could suffer from many limitations associated with synthetic data generation,\nincluding but not limited to:\nExtensibility: Creating the agentic flows for different skills depends on human effort for\nthe construction of the flows. Future work should consider how to automate the construction\nof the agentic flow from the user specification.\nAccuracy: Synthetic data may not perfectly replicate the complexity and nuances of real-\nworld data, leading to potential inaccuracies. Additional work is needed to better assess the\nquality of the data.\nCost: Generating synthetic data with multiple agents using LLMs and tools can be resource-\nintensive.\nBias:If the original seed data used to generate synthetic data contains biases, these biases\ncan be reflected and even amplified in the synthetic data.\nValidation : It can be difficult to validate synthetic data to ensure it accurately represents\nthe desired scenarios.\nDependency on Seed Data : The quality of synthetic data is dependent on the quality of\nthe real data used as seeds. Poor quality input data could result in poor quality synthetic\ndata.\nOrca-3 is fine-tuned with the AgentInstruct data based on the Mistral model family, and\nretains many of its limitations, as well as the common limitations of other large language\nmodels and limitations originating from its training process, including:\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\nbiases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\nas “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\ndecisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information2.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\nactions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\nprovided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better\nregulations and standards from\nOutput:"}}

We have used unstructured text and code files sampled from\nKnowledgePile[ 7], AutoMathText[ 38], a subset of openstax and a subset of apache-2.0\nlicensed source code files from [ 4]. The dataset covers variety of skills, as detailed in Table 1.\nUsing unstructured content as seeds for instruction data generation has several benefits.\nFirst, there is abundance of such data enabling the generation of large-scale and diverse\ninstruction data. Additionally, it enables us to avoid using any benchmark-specific data as\nseeds and hence focus on optimizing for a capability, not for a specific benchmark.\nIn addition to the 22 million instructions, we have incorporated approximately 3.8 million\npaired instructions sourced from Orca-1[ 21], Orca-2[ 18], Orca-Math[ 19] and samples from\nother publicly available sources such as [ 5,37,10,30]. We refer to this data as Orca-2.5-\ndataset.\nThe culmination of these datasets results in approximately 25.8 million paired instructions,\nall of which are incorporated into the training of Orca-3. Furthermore, we have trained a\nseparate model, referred to as Orca-2.5, using the 3.8 million instructions (Orca-2.5-dataset).\nThe purpose of this is to compare and evaluate the impact of the 22 million instructions\ncurated through AgentInstruct.\n3.2 Training Details\nWe use the 25.8 million paired instructions described earlier to finetune Mistral-7b-v0.1.\nWe choose this model because the it makes the weights publicly available for the base\n(no-instruction-tuned) version, with a permissive license allowing easy redistribution. We\nrefer to the finetuned model ( Mistral-7b-v0.1 finetuned on AgentInstruct dataset) as Orca-3.\nEach pair in the dataset undergoes a tokenization process using the Mistral tokenizer,\nensuring a maximum sequence length of 8192 with packing. To guarantee that the training\nloss is calculated based only on the response conditioned on the prompt, label masking is\napplied. Weight decay was set at 0.1\nThe finetuneing used 19 NVIDIA A100 nodes, or 152 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with a\nbatch size of 10. We used AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 8e-6 and a a\ncosine learning rate schedule. We also used a linear learning rate warm-up during the initial\n500 steps. The model was trained for three epochs and the training process concluded after\napproximately 200 hours.\n4 Evaluation Results\n4.1 Orca-Bench\nThe Orca-Bench dataset serves as a held-out test set, consisting of 100 samples from each of\nthe 17 skills for which data was curated using AgentInstruct, except for the Open Domain\nQuestion Answering (ODQA) category, where we created two test sets. The first subset,\nreferred to as ODQA, consists of 100 questions originated from the initial seed instruction\nphase. The second subset, termed Complex ODQA, includes more intricate questions\ndeveloped during the refinement phase.\nWe evaluated the performance of all baselines using the Orca-Bench dataset. These were\nscored relative to GPT-4 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. It is worth noting that some of\nthe entries within Orca-Bench involve multiple exchanges. To illustrate, let a multi-turn\ninteraction in Orca-Bench be denoted by\nOutput:"}}

To calculate a\nstudent’s overall score, we sum the student’s individual scores and divide this total by the\nsum of the teacher’s scores. This ratio is then multiplied by 10 to normalize the student’s\nfinal score to a 0 to 10 scale.\nAgentInstruct’s objective is to synthesize a large and diverse corpus of data with varying\ndegrees of difficulty. An efficacious execution of this strategy should yield a dataset against\nwhich baseline models like Orca-2.5, Mistral-Instruct-7b, and ChatGPT score substantially\nbelow 10, demonstrating their relative inferiority to GPT-4—a model that is designated as\nthe benchmark with a score of 10.

The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Here we provide an example\ninput and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.\n8EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nRandom Seed\nApril 6-8, 2017, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA. Abstracts due December 1, 2016.\nFinance is hard to escape. In recent years, the increasing social impact and interconnection\nof financial discourses, markets, actors, and institutions have been understood under the\nbroad concept of financialization. Natascha van der Zwan identifies three distinct research\nstreams that have approached financialization as 1) a regime of accumulation, 2) the influence\nof financial markets and instruments on non-financial corporations as well as the banking\nand finance industry, and 3) a discourse of risk-taking, self-management and self-fulfillment\nthat is transforming people into investing subjects. Some anthropological skeptics, however,\nargue that finance has a far longer genealogy than the financialization literature has to date\nrecognized. For example, in the context of a lengthy human history of creating hierarchy,\nfinancialization may simply be a new technology serving an old purpose.\n... (omitted for brevity)... ·The supply chains of financial products connect different places\nand political projects across the globe. How do such financial instruments transform social\nlife?\nAbstract deadline is December 1, 2016.\n1. Go to americananthro.org and log in. If you don’t have a login id and password, create\none (you do not need to join the American Anthropological Association).\n2. Once you are logged in, look to the left hand column, click on Meeting registration.\n3. Click on register under the SEA 2017 Annual Meeting then follow online prompts to\nregister for the meeting (if we do not accept your abstract and you decide not to attend,\nyou may request that your registration fee be refunded and we would be happy to do so).\n4. Once you are registered, AAA will automatically send you an email inviting you to submit\nan abstract. Click the link and follow the instructions.\nTask:\nRewrite the event details (date, location, abstract deadline) in a more casual tone.\nGiven a random seed, the seed instruction creation flow randomly picks one of the 18agents\nand uses that to obtain a seed (text, text modification instruction) pair.\nInstruction Refinement Flow The refinement flow consists of only one Suggester-Editor\npair. The Suggester-Editor duo increase the complexity of the generated instructions while\ntaking as input the text and the task modification instruction as input. Here we show three\nsuggestions and edits as proposed by the suggester-editor pair.\nEXAMPLE: IRefinement Flow\nSuggestions\nSuggestion 1: Incorporate a fictional narrative. Use a conversational style with colloquial\nlanguage and include a humorous element.\nSuggestion 2: Translate the event details into a poetic format. Maintain accurate infor-\nmation while using rhyming couplets and ensure the tone remains light and\nengaging.\nSuggestion 3: Frame the event details as a social media post. Use internet slang and\nemojis. Keep the message within 280 characters.\nModified Instructions\nInstruction 1: Rewrite the event details (date, location, abstract deadline) as if you’re\ntelling a funny story to a friend using casual and colloquial language,\nwhile incorporating a fictional narrative that still conveys the necessary\ninformation.\nInstruction 2: Transform the event details (date, location, abstract deadline) into a light-\nheartedpoemwithrhymingcouplets, ensuringthattheessentialinformation\nis accurately conveyed in a poetic format.\nInstruction 3: Craft a social media post that includes the event details (date, location,\nabstract deadline) using internet slang, emojis, and a casual tone, while\nkeeping the message concise and within 280 characters.\n92.3 AgentInstruct Flow for Tool Use\nThe task of tool use or API use for LLMs involves enabling models to interact with external\ntools or services; via APIs. This capability allows AI systems to extend their functionality,\naccess external data, and perform actions beyond their native capabilities.\nContent Transformation Flow We use source code snippets or an API description [ 26] as\nthe random seed. If source code snippets has been used as the seed, a content transformation\nagent is used to synthesize an API description from the code snippet. The goal of the\nContent Transformation Flow is to synthesize list of APIs from the random seed. API lists\nare created by either: (1) using an API retrieval agent that iteratively searches for similar\ncode to expand the API list or (2) the agent uses the LLM to hypothesize other APIs present\nin the library.\nThe following figure provides an example of the library reconstruction scenario.\nEXAMPLE: Content Transformation Flow [Library Reconstruction]\nSeed\n{\n\"name\": \"View All Food Items\",\n\"description\": \"The request enables clients to obtain a detailed list of food items,\ncomplete with nutritional profiles such as calorie count, protein, fat, ...\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"limit\": {\n\"type\": \"NUMBER\",\n\"description\": \"limit the length of response\"\n}\n},\n\"required\": []\n}\n}\nReconstructed Remaining APIs from the Library\n[\n{\n\"name\": \"Search Food Items\",\n\"description\": \"Allows clients to search for food items by name and retrieve a list of\nmatching items ...\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"type\": \"object\",\n\"properties\": {\n\"query\": {\n\"type\": \"string\",\n\"description\": \"The name or partial name of the food item to search for.\"\n},\n\"limit\": {\n\"type\": \"number\",\n\"description\": \"Optional parameter to limit the number of search results\nreturned.\"\n\nOutput:"}}

Conversely, low levels of uric acid, or hypouricemia,\nare less common and usually do not present symptoms. Nonetheless, they can be indicative\nof underlying kidney or liver issues. Diagnosing either condition requires laboratory blood\nand urine tests. It is important to note that while high uric acid levels are associated with\nan increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the causal relationship remains to be conclusively\nestablished.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 43\nreading comprehension questions types. The list includes literal comprehension questions,\ncritical comprehension questions, evaluative comprehension questions, reasoning, identifying\nassumptions, identifying information that strengthens/weakens an argument, ordering events,\netc.\nA list some of these types is in Appendix A.\nWe have defined multiple Agents targeting these categories. Each of these agent receives as\ninput a piece of text and generates a list of questions based on a predefined question type.\nThe orchestration process will engage a subset of these agents, determined by the content\ntransformation agent in the preceding step. Upon completion of this phase, we will obtain a\ncollection of (passage, question) pairs that will constitute the input for the subsequent stage.\nThe following figure provides an example of Strengthen type question that is generated from\nthe running example.\nEXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nWhich one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument that high lev-\nels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?\n(A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid levels in the\nblood.\n(C) Dietary supplements have been shown to reduce uric acid levels in the blood.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found to have\nuric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease are more likely to have high\nuric acid levels.\nInstruction Refinement Flow The refinement flow contains multiple suggester-editor\nagents that will go through each of the (passage, question) pairs and create more such pairs\nwith the following goals: (1) Modify the passage to make the question unanswerable, (2)\nModify the passage to alter the answer, if possible, in opposite direction, or (3) Modify the\nquestions or answer choices (if applicable) to make them complex.\nHere is an example where the suggester agent that tries to add a difficult distractor to\nconfuse the test taker.\n7EXAMPLE: Refinement Flow\nSUGGESTER\n•Suggestion 1 Introduce a hypothetical study or finding that could potentially\nstrengthen the argument, requiring the test-taker to infer its impact on the rela-\ntionship between uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease.\n•Suggestion 2 Add a layer of complexity by suggesting a genetic predisposition\nto hyperuricemia and its correlation with increased cardiovascular events, which\nwould require the test-taker to consider both genetic and physiological factors.\n•Suggestion 3 Include a distractor option that seems to strengthen the argument\nbut upon closer examination, it does not directly relate to the causal relationship\nbetween uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease, thus testing the test-taker’s\nability to discern relevant from irrelevant information.\nEDITOR\n•Modification 1,2 (omitted for brevity)\n•Modification 3 Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument\nthat high levels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?\n(A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid\nlevels in the blood.\n(C) A placebo-controlled trial shows that individuals taking uric acid-lowering\nmedication do not exhibit a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease compared\nto the placebo group.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found\nto have uric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) A cross-sectional study finds that high uric acid levels are associated with other\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but does\nnot establish a direct causal link.\n2.2 AgentInstruct Flow for Text Modification\nText modification is the process of editing and refining written content to enhance its quality\nand effectiveness or alter its attributes. This involves correcting spelling and grammar,\nclarifyingideas, reorganizingcontentforbetterflow, adjustingtone, ensuringstyleconsistency,\nfact-checking, removingredundancies, formatting, developingcontent, andadaptingtospecific\naudiences. It is a useful skill for LLMs that help in content writing. While several content\ntransformation agents can be introduced to intentionally modify the text as described earlier,\nwe focus here on showing the how the instructions are created and refined.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 18types\nof text modification tasks including paraphrasing, expansion, simplification, redacting or\nremoving content, styling, code switching, etc. The full list is in Appendix A.\nWe define an Agent for each of the task type. Each agent takes as input a piece of text and\ncreates several text modification tasks of the associated type. Here we provide an example\ninput and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.\n8EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nRandom Seed\nApril 6-8, 2017, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

Note: The\nscores for Gemini Pro are taken from the original paper [34]\n4.6 Evaluation: Abstractive Summarization\nSummarization is an important capability for Language Models, with many models achieving\nhigh quality summarization performance, yet struggling with hallucination. We assessed\nsummarization ability using two key metrics: hallucinations and quality. For this purpose,\nwe utilized GPT4 as our evaluator. The prompts utilized in these evaluations can be found\nin Appendix B. We used the following benchmarks for evaluating summarization abilities:\n•ACI-Bench: The Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark (ACI-Bench) [ 32] is a\ndataset designed for benchmarking automatic report generation from doctor-patient\nconversations. The test set comprises 120 data points.\n•InstruSum: A dataset [ 15] for evaluating the generation capabilities LLMs for\ninstruction-controllable summarization. It consists of 100 datapoints.\n•Orca-Sum: A newly created benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ ability to follow summa-\nrization and grounded data transformation instructions. To construct this test set,\nwe sampled data from 45 summarization datasets collected from Hugging Face across\nmultiple domains such as news, conversations, science, health, social, e-mails, code,\netc. for a total of 458 datapoints. We randomly collected, up to 1000 datapoints\nwhich then we carefully deduplicated to avoid overlapping with the training set. We\nthen used GPT-4 to generate a set of 40 prompts for each dataset out of each we\nrandomly sampled one for each selected datapoint. The prompts are dataset-specific\nand focus on summarization, grounding, and data transformation. For instance, a\nprompt may ask the model to generate a TikTok video out of a scientific paper or\na legal contract from a Wikipedia page. This allows us to measure not only the\nquality of the response but also hallucination in a challenging scenario, as the model\nis forced to move between formats and domains.\nThe results are presented in Table 7. With the AgentInstruct approach, we successfully\nachieved a reduction in hallucinations by 31.34%, while attaining a quality level comparable\nto GPT4 (Teacher).\n4.7 Evaluation: RAG\nThe RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) skill significantly boosts the capacity of Lan-\nguage Models to generate informed, contextually precise responses, hence upgrading their\noverall performance and usefulness. It is arguably more effective to test the RAG proficiency\nof language models in areas where the models have limited knowledge. For this study, we\nselected MIRAGE[ 35], a benchmark that focuses on answering medical questions by referring\nto information retrieved from a medical corpus. Since the medical domain is not typically a\nprimary focus of the models evaluated in this study, MIRAGE provides an effective platform\nfor assessing their RAG capabilities. Additionally, AgentInstruct RAG data used generic,\nnon medical data seed, enabling us to test how well can the skill (RAG) be applied to new\ndomains.\n19ModelOrca-3\n-7BOrca-2.5\n-7BMistral-\n7B-InstructLLAMA3-\n8B-instructGPT-3.5-\nturboGPT-4\nHallucination Rate (%) - Smaller is better\nAll (micro) 21.09\n(-26.12%,\n-31.34%)28.55 30.72 34.22 21.13 15.07\nOrca-Sum 28.17 36.84 39.61 38.43 28.60 21.66\nInstruSum 9.00 12.00 17.00 25.00 12.00 1.00\nACI-Bench 4.20 10.83 8.30 25.83 1.70 1.70\nQuality Score (1-10) - Higher is better\nAll (micro) 9.14\n(+7.91%,\n+3.28%)8.47 8.85 9.00 8.69 9.08\nOrca-Sum 8.95 8.27 8.61 8.90 8.32 8.61\nInstruSum 9.17 8.30 9.16 9.21 9.27 9.31\nACI-Bench 9.72 9.39 9.48 9.23 9.60 9.70\nTable 7: Hallucination rates and quality scores evaluated by GPT4.

Seed Instruction Generation\nFlow creates instances of the target tasks following a taxonomy. Refinement Flow explores\nthe space further by starting from these initial data points and exploring the neighborhood.\nThe expectation is that by picking a random seed we will be able to cover the entire region\nof data points.\nmultiple agents and is often instrumental in the generation of high-quality data and serve as\nan additional means to introduce diversity.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow comprising of multiple agents takes as input the\ntransformed seed from the Content Transformation Flow and generates a set of diverse\ninstructions. The only goal of the Seed Instruction Flow is to introduce diversity for which\nit often relies on a pre-defined, but extensible, taxonomy.\nInstruction Refinement Flow takes as input the instructions from the Seed Instruction\nFlow and iteratively enhances their complexity and quality. Towards this we use the concept\nof Suggester-Editor Agents[ 19]. Suggester agents initially propose various approaches to\nincrease the intricacy of the initial instructions (making them more complex, unsolvable,\nor tricky), after which the Editor agents modify the instructions in accordance with these\nsuggestions.\nEach flow consists of a number of agents. We use a generic definition of an agent, where an\nagent is powered by an LLM and can optionally have the ability to use tools such as search\nAPIs, code interpreter or a calculator. Each agent has a specific role and set of instructions\nspecified as part of the underlying LLM system message.\nWe implemented these flows for 17 different skills, each having multiple subcategories.\nThe skills include reading comprehension, question answering, coding, retrieval augmented\ngeneration, creative writing, tool/API use and Web control. The full list is provided in\nTable 1\nWe explain how the workflows work with case studies of generating data for the following\nthree skills:\nReading Comprehension: The ability to understand, process, and interpret written text.\nText Modification: The process of altering text to suit different purposes.\nTool Use: The employment of functions or APIs to perform tasks or solve problems.\n4Reading Comprehension: Reading comprehension is a critical skill involving processing and un-\nderstanding text, which is necessary for learning and encompasses decoding, fluency, and vocabulary\nknowledge. Reading comprehension tests typically present text passages of varying lengths and\nsubjects, followed by questions that assess the reader’s understanding.\nOpen Domain Question Answering: Open domain question answering involves generating\nresponses to questions over a wide range of topics, without being restricted to a specific domain.\nText Modification: Text modification involves changing existing text to improve its quality,\nmodify its tone, or to fit a specific context or audience. It is a common task in content creation and\nediting.\nWeb Agent: A web agent is a software program that autonomously performs tasks on the web,\nsuch as where to click, how much to scroll.\nBrain Teaser A brain teaser is a problem or puzzle, typically requiring thought to solve, often for\namusement but also used for training logical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nAnalytical Reasoning Analytical reasoning involves the ability to look at information, be it\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, and discern patterns within the information. It’s a process\nthat includes understanding a system of relationships and draw logical conclusions about those\nrelationships.\nMultiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions are a form of assessment where respondents\nare asked to select the best possible answer (or answers) out of the choices from a list. They are\ncommon in standardized tests, quizzes, and surveys.\nData To Text Data-to-text refers to human-readable textual summaries from source data. These\ncould be used for generating reports, explanations, or narratives from structured data.\nFermiFermi problems are estimation problems which seek quick, rough estimates of quantities\nwhich can be difficult to measure. Named after physicist Enrico Fermi, these problems often require\nmaking justified guesses or assumptions to reach a solution.\nCoding Coding involves writing code following instructions, understanding code, debugging code,\ntracing or writing test cases.\nText Extraction Text extraction is the process of retrieving relevant information from a larger text\ndocument. This can include tasks like named entity recognition, keyword extraction, or extracting\nspecific data fields from unstructured text.\nText\nOutput:"}}

Reading comprehension is a very important\ncapability and can enable scenarios like question answering, search, grounded reasoning, etc.\nContent Transformation Flow Web crawls encompass an extensive collection of human-\ngenerated text, which holds potential for generating reading comprehension materials.\nHowever, these sources are not inherently structured to facilitate the teaching of read-\ning comprehension skills. Consequently, they do not support the consistent generation of\ndiverse question types required for comprehensive reading comprehension evaluation. For\ninstance, the LSAT Logical Reasoning test features specialized question categories, including\nassumption, strengthening/weakening, flaw, and inference questions. Crafting such questions\nnecessitates passages with a particular stylistic and logical framework. The objective of\nContent Transformation Flow is to transform arbitrary articles into well-crafted pieces that\nare conducive to the formulation of a wide array of reading comprehension question types.\nOur current flow for Reading Comprehension encompasses a suite of nine content transfor-\nmation agents for generating argument passages, debates and conversations, long passages,\nmeeting transcripts, poems, satarical content, etc. Detailed description is provided in Ap-\npendix A. Given a seed article, the flow will randomly pick one of the Content Transformation\nAgents to assess the seed article and attempt to generate the text passages. The following\nprovides an example for the Argument Passage Generator .\nEXAMPLE: Content Transformation Flow\nRandom Seed\nUric acid is a substance produced naturally by the breakdown of purine (a type of dietary\nprotein). When it is in excess in the body, crystals composed of these substances are formed.\nThese crystals are deposited in various parts of the body, mainly in the joints and kidneys,\ncausing pain and other aggravations. The lack or excess of uric acid in the body is caused by\nsome diseases (such as leukemia, obesity, kidney diseases, and anemia) and factors related\nto lifestyle (consumption of alcohol and processed foods, for example).\nContents\n•Where does purine come from?\n•Where is uric acid found?\n•What is high uric acid?\n•What can high uric acid cause?\n•What is low uric acid?\n•Tests: how to know uric acid levels?\nWhere does purine come from?\nPurine is produced and released into the bloodstream when an amino acid is broken down\nby digestion. Therefore, it is produced naturally in the body. ... (Truncated)\n6Transformed Seed (Argument Passage Generator)\nRecent studies have indicated that high levels of uric acid in the blood, known as hyper-\nuricemia, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Uric acid is a byproduct of purine\nmetabolism, and while it is naturally produced in the body, excessive amounts can lead to\nhealth complications. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as levels above 6 mg/dL in women\nand 7 mg/dL in men. This condition can result from increased production of uric acid or\ninsufficient elimination through urine. Factors contributing to high uric acid include a diet\nrich in purines, found in red meat and seafood, as well as lifestyle choices such as alcohol\nconsumption and physical inactivity. Conversely, low levels of uric acid, or hypouricemia,\nare less common and usually do not present symptoms. Nonetheless, they can be indicative\nof underlying kidney or liver issues. Diagnosing either condition requires laboratory blood\nand urine tests. It is important to note that while high uric acid levels are associated with\nan increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the causal\nOutput:"}}

This involves using the same retrieval function\nand the same number of retrieved documents for all models. As all models are presented\nwith the same set of retrieved documents, the comparison accurately reflects the ability of\ndifferent models to incorporate retrieved results into their responses.\nTable 8 shows the results of all models on MIRAGE with and without leveraging RAG1.\nOverall, we observe that\n•Models with a deeper understanding of the task (CoT scores) tend to have higher\nRAG scores. If we restrict our focus to only RAG performance, applying post-\ntraining, we’ve managed to enhance Mistral’s performance by an average of 38.30%.\n1Results of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo are from [35].\n20•Of the five datasets in MIRAGE, PubMedQA arguably offers the most effective\ntestbed for assessing models ability to do RAG. In PubMedQA, all models have\nlimited prior knowledge, and the retrieved context provides essential information, as\ndemonstrated by GPT4’s performance leap. All Mistral fine-tunes exhibit similar\nperformance, but only Orca-3 (Mistral trained with AgentInstruct RAG flow data)\nshows a substantial improvement, resulting in a relative improvement of 92.71% over\nMistral-Instruct.\n5 Limitations\nAgentInstruct reduces human expertise required for data generation significantly and enables\ncreating of high-quality synthetic data at scale. However, this is till an early step in this\ndirection and could suffer from many limitations associated with synthetic data generation,\nincluding but not limited to:\nExtensibility: Creating the agentic flows for different skills depends on human effort for\nthe construction of the flows. Future work should consider how to automate the construction\nof the agentic flow from the user specification.\nAccuracy: Synthetic data may not perfectly replicate the complexity and nuances of real-\nworld data, leading to potential inaccuracies. Additional work is needed to better assess the\nquality of the data.\nCost: Generating synthetic data with multiple agents using LLMs and tools can be resource-\nintensive.\nBias:If the original seed data used to generate synthetic data contains biases, these biases\ncan be reflected and even amplified in the synthetic data.\nValidation : It can be difficult to validate synthetic data to ensure it accurately represents\nthe desired scenarios.\nDependency on Seed Data : The quality of synthetic data is dependent on the quality of\nthe real data used as seeds. Poor quality input data could result in poor quality synthetic\ndata.\nOrca-3 is fine-tuned with the AgentInstruct data based on the Mistral model family, and\nretains many of its limitations, as well as the common limitations of other large language\nmodels and limitations originating from its training process, including:\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\nbiases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\nas “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\ndecisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information2.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\nactions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\nprovided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better\nregulations and standards from\nOutput:"}}

We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information2.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\nactions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\nprovided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better\nregulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms\nfor AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research\nand open source community can play in this direction.\nHallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given\nlanguage model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is\nnot obvious how to prevent these models from fabricating content. Moreover, it is not clear\nwhether small models may be more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation\nuse cases due to their smaller sizes and hence reduced memorization capacities. This is an\n2https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/\ntransparency-note\n21active research topic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding\nand mitigations around this topic.\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could\nbe maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\nData Distribution: Orca-3’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution\nof the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in\nthe training dataset.\n6 Conclusions\nThe AgentInstruct approach to Generative Teaching offers a promising solution to the\nchallenge of generating large amount of diverse and high-quality data for model post-training.\nThis method stands out by using agentic flows for synthetic data generation, thus addressing\nkey concerns associated with the use of synthetic data in model training, such as the lack of\ndiversity and the need for intensive human curation and intervention during the data creation\nprocess. By leveraging an agentic framework, AgentInstruct can generate tailored datasets\ncomprising both prompts and responses from unstructured data sources, facilitating the\npost-training of models and teaching them variety of skills. The efficacy of this approach is\nexemplifiedbythesubstantialimprovementobserved intheOrca-3 model, which, post-trained\nwith a 25M pair dataset generated by AgentInstruct, showcased a notable performance gain\nacross multiple benchmarks. We believe using agentic flows for creating synthetic data can\nshow significant value for all stages of model training, including pre-training, post-training\nand domain/task specialization. The ability to use unstructured content to generate diverse\nand high-quality instruction data given any specifications could pave the way for creating\n(semi) automated pipelines using synthetic data for model customization (using domain\nspecific content as seeds) and continual improvement (generating higher quality data than\nthe base model with agentic flows).\nReferences\n[1]Marah Abdin, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah,\nHany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, Amit Bahree, Arash Bakhtiari, Jianmin Bao, Harkirat Behl,\nAlon Benhaim, Misha Bilenko, Johan Bjorck, Sébastien Bubeck, Qin Cai, Martin Cai, Caio\nCésar Teodoro Mendes, Weizhu Chen, Vishrav Chaudhary, Dong Chen, Dongdong Chen,\nYen-Chun Chen, Yi-Ling Chen, Parul Chopra, Xiyang Dai, Allie Del Giorno, Gustavo de Rosa,\nMatthew Dixon, Ronen Eldan, Victor Fragoso, Dan Iter, Mei Gao, Min Gao, Jianfeng Gao,\nAmit Garg, Abhishek Goswami, Suriya Gunasekar, Emman Haider, Junheng Hao, Russell J.\nHewett, Jamie Huynh, Mojan Javaheripi, Xin Jin, Piero Kauffmann, Nikos Karampatziakis,\nDongwoo Kim, Mahoud Khademi, Lev Kurilenko, James R.

This enables us to create data at scale (benefiting from\nautomation of agentic flows), with high diversity (based on the broad and diverse seeds) and\nof varying complexity (benefiting from the iterative and refinement patterns supported by\nagentic flows). AgentInstruct defines three different flows:\nContent Transformation Flow converts the raw seed into an intermediate representation\nthat simplifies the creation of instructions tailored to specific objectives. It comprises of\n31\nContent Transformation Flow…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...………………\n………………\n………………\n……Raw text \ndocuments or \nsource code \nfiles are used \nas seedsTransformed \ncontent ( e.g.  \nargument passage, \nmeeting transcript, \nlist of APIs,….)\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow\n……Transformed \ncontent provide \ndiversity is easier \nto use to generate \ninstructions Seed instructions \nare generated \nfollowing  a \ncomprehensive \ntaxonomy…...…...…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...\n3\nInstruction Refinement Flow\nIteratively refine the instructions \nto boost quality, diversity and \ncomplexity\n2Figure 3: Figure provides a thematic overview of the roles played by different groups of\nagents. Content Transformation Flow converts the seed into an intermediate representation\nthat makes it easier to create high quality and diverse data. Seed Instruction Generation\nFlow creates instances of the target tasks following a taxonomy. Refinement Flow explores\nthe space further by starting from these initial data points and exploring the neighborhood.\nThe expectation is that by picking a random seed we will be able to cover the entire region\nof data points.\nmultiple agents and is often instrumental in the generation of high-quality data and serve as\nan additional means to introduce diversity.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow comprising of multiple agents takes as input the\ntransformed seed from the Content Transformation Flow and generates a set of diverse\ninstructions. The only goal of the Seed Instruction Flow is to introduce diversity for which\nit often relies on a pre-defined, but extensible, taxonomy.\nInstruction Refinement Flow takes as input the instructions from the Seed Instruction\nFlow and iteratively enhances their complexity and quality. Towards this we use the concept\nof Suggester-Editor Agents[ 19]. Suggester agents initially propose various approaches to\nincrease the intricacy of the initial instructions (making them more complex, unsolvable,\nor tricky), after which the Editor agents modify the instructions in accordance with these\nsuggestions.\nEach flow consists of a number of agents. We use a generic definition of an agent, where an\nagent is powered by an LLM and can optionally have the ability to use tools such as search\nAPIs, code interpreter or a calculator. Each agent has a specific role and set of instructions\nspecified as part of the underlying LLM system message.\nWe implemented these flows for 17 different skills, each having multiple subcategories.\nThe skills include reading comprehension, question answering, coding, retrieval augmented\ngeneration, creative writing, tool/API use and Web control. The full list is provided in\nTable 1\nWe explain how the workflows work with case studies of generating data for the following\nthree skills:\nReading Comprehension: The ability to understand, process, and interpret written text.\nText Modification: The process of altering text to suit different purposes.\nTool Use: The employment of functions or APIs to perform tasks or solve problems.\n4Reading Comprehension: Reading comprehension is a critical skill involving processing and un-\nderstanding text, which is necessary for learning and encompasses decoding, fluency, and vocabulary\nknowledge. Reading comprehension tests typically present text passages of varying lengths and\nsubjects, followed by questions that assess the reader’s understanding.\nOpen Domain Question Answering: Open domain question answering involves generating\nresponses to questions over a wide range of topics, without being restricted to a specific domain.\nText Modification: Text modification involves changing existing text to improve its quality,\nmodify its tone, or to fit a specific context or audience. It is a common task in content creation and\nediting.\nWeb Agent: A web agent is a software program that autonomously performs tasks on the web,\nsuch as where to click, how much to scroll.\nBrain Teaser A brain teaser is a problem or puzzle, typically requiring thought to solve, often for\namusement but also used for training logical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nAnalytical Reasoning Analytical reasoning involves the ability to look at information, be it\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, and discern patterns within the information. It’s a process\nthat includes understanding a system of relationships and draw logical conclusions about those\nrelationships.\nMultiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions are a form of assessment where respondents\nare asked to select the best possible answer (or answers) out of the choices from a list. They are\ncommon in standardized tests, quizzes, and surveys.\nData To Text Data-to-text refers to human-readable textual summaries from source data. These\ncould be used for generating reports, explanations, or narratives from structured data.\nFermiFermi problems are estimation problems which seek quick, rough estimates of quantities\nwhich can be difficult to measure.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized.

Conversely, low levels of uric acid, or hypouricemia,\nare less common and usually do not present symptoms. Nonetheless, they can be indicative\nof underlying kidney or liver issues. Diagnosing either condition requires laboratory blood\nand urine tests. It is important to note that while high uric acid levels are associated with\nan increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the causal relationship remains to be conclusively\nestablished.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 43\nreading comprehension questions types. The list includes literal comprehension questions,\ncritical comprehension questions, evaluative comprehension questions, reasoning, identifying\nassumptions, identifying information that strengthens/weakens an argument, ordering events,\netc.\nA list some of these types is in Appendix A.\nWe have defined multiple Agents targeting these categories. Each of these agent receives as\ninput a piece of text and generates a list of questions based on a predefined question type.\nThe orchestration process will engage a subset of these agents, determined by the content\ntransformation agent in the preceding step. Upon completion of this phase, we will obtain a\ncollection of (passage, question) pairs that will constitute the input for the subsequent stage.\nThe following figure provides an example of Strengthen type question that is generated from\nthe running example.\nEXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nWhich one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument that high lev-\nels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?\n(A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid levels in the\nblood.\n(C) Dietary supplements have been shown to reduce uric acid levels in the blood.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found to have\nuric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease are more likely to have high\nuric acid levels.\nInstruction Refinement Flow The refinement flow contains multiple suggester-editor\nagents that will go through each of the (passage, question) pairs and create more such pairs\nwith the following goals: (1) Modify the passage to make the question unanswerable, (2)\nModify the passage to alter the answer, if possible, in opposite direction, or (3) Modify the\nquestions or answer choices (if applicable) to make them complex.\nHere is an example where the suggester agent that tries to add a difficult distractor to\nconfuse the test taker.\n7EXAMPLE: Refinement Flow\nSUGGESTER\n•Suggestion 1 Introduce a hypothetical study or finding that could potentially\nstrengthen the argument, requiring the test-taker to infer its impact on the rela-\ntionship between uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease.\n•Suggestion 2 Add a layer of complexity by suggesting a genetic predisposition\nto hyperuricemia and its correlation with increased cardiovascular events, which\nwould require the test-taker to consider both genetic and physiological factors.\n•Suggestion 3 Include a distractor option that seems to strengthen the argument\nbut upon closer examination, it does not directly relate to the causal relationship\nbetween uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease, thus testing the test-taker’s\nability to discern relevant from irrelevant information.\nEDITOR\n•Modification 1,2 (omitted for brevity)\n•Modification 3 Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument\nthat high levels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?\n(A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid\nlevels in the blood.\n(C) A placebo-controlled trial shows that individuals taking uric acid-lowering\nmedication do not exhibit a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease compared\nto the placebo group.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found\nto have uric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) A cross-sectional study finds that high uric acid levels are associated with other\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but does\nnot establish a direct causal link.\n2.2 AgentInstruct Flow for Text Modification\nText modification is the process of editing and refining written content to enhance its quality\nand effectiveness or alter its attributes. This involves correcting spelling and grammar,\nclarifyingideas, reorganizingcontentforbetterflow, adjustingtone, ensuringstyleconsistency,\nfact-checking, removingredundancies, formatting, developingcontent, andadaptingtospecific\naudiences. It is a useful skill for LLMs that help in content writing. While several content\ntransformation agents can be introduced to intentionally modify the text as described earlier,\nwe focus here on showing the how the instructions are created and refined.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 18types\nof text modification tasks including paraphrasing, expansion, simplification, redacting or\nremoving content, styling, code switching, etc. The full list is in Appendix A.\nWe define an Agent for each of the task type. Each agent takes as input a piece of text and\ncreates several text modification tasks of the associated type. Here we provide an example\ninput and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.\n8EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nRandom Seed\nApril 6-8, 2017, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This enables us to create data at scale (benefiting from\nautomation of agentic flows), with high diversity (based on the broad and diverse seeds) and\nof varying complexity (benefiting from the iterative and refinement patterns supported by\nagentic flows). AgentInstruct defines three different flows:\nContent Transformation Flow converts the raw seed into an intermediate representation\nthat simplifies the creation of instructions tailored to specific objectives. It comprises of\n31\nContent Transformation Flow…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...………………\n………………\n………………\n……Raw text \ndocuments or \nsource code \nfiles are used \nas seedsTransformed \ncontent ( e.g.  \nargument passage, \nmeeting transcript, \nlist of APIs,….)\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow\n……Transformed \ncontent provide \ndiversity is easier \nto use to generate \ninstructions Seed instructions \nare generated \nfollowing  a \ncomprehensive \ntaxonomy…...…...…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...\n3\nInstruction Refinement Flow\nIteratively refine the instructions \nto boost quality, diversity and \ncomplexity\n2Figure 3: Figure provides a thematic overview of the roles played by different groups of\nagents. Content Transformation Flow converts the seed into an intermediate representation\nthat makes it easier to create high quality and diverse data. Seed Instruction Generation\nFlow creates instances of the target tasks following a taxonomy. Refinement Flow explores\nthe space further by starting from these initial data points and exploring the neighborhood.\nThe expectation is that by picking a random seed we will be able to cover the entire region\nof data points.\nmultiple agents and is often instrumental in the generation of high-quality data and serve as\nan additional means to introduce diversity.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow comprising of multiple agents takes as input the\ntransformed seed from the Content Transformation Flow and generates a set of diverse\ninstructions. The only goal of the Seed Instruction Flow is to introduce diversity for which\nit often relies on a pre-defined, but extensible, taxonomy.\nInstruction Refinement Flow takes as input the instructions from the Seed Instruction\nFlow and iteratively enhances their complexity and quality. Towards this we use the concept\nof Suggester-Editor Agents[ 19]. Suggester agents initially propose various approaches to\nincrease the intricacy of the initial instructions (making them more complex, unsolvable,\nor tricky), after which the Editor agents modify the instructions in accordance with these\nsuggestions.\nEach flow consists of a number of agents. We use a generic definition of an agent, where an\nagent is powered by an LLM and can optionally have the ability to use tools such as search\nAPIs, code interpreter or a calculator. Each agent has a specific role and set of instructions\nspecified as part of the underlying LLM system message.\nWe implemented these flows for 17 different skills, each having multiple subcategories.\nThe skills include reading comprehension, question answering, coding, retrieval augmented\ngeneration, creative writing, tool/API use and Web control. The full list is provided in\nTable 1\nWe explain how the workflows work with case studies of generating data for the following\nthree skills:\nReading Comprehension: The ability to understand, process, and interpret written text.\nText Modification: The process of altering text to suit different purposes.\nTool Use: The employment of functions or APIs to perform tasks or solve problems.\n4Reading Comprehension: Reading comprehension is a critical skill involving processing and un-\nderstanding text, which is necessary for learning and encompasses decoding, fluency, and vocabulary\nknowledge. Reading comprehension tests typically present text passages of varying lengths and\nsubjects, followed by questions that assess the reader’s understanding.\nOpen Domain Question Answering: Open domain question answering involves generating\nresponses to questions over a wide range of topics, without being restricted to a specific domain.\nText Modification: Text modification involves changing existing text to improve its quality,\nmodify its tone, or to fit a specific context or audience. It is a common task in content creation and\nediting.\nWeb Agent: A web agent is a software program that autonomously performs tasks on the web,\nsuch as where to click, how much to scroll.\nBrain Teaser A brain teaser is a problem or puzzle, typically requiring thought to solve, often for\namusement but also used for training logical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nAnalytical Reasoning Analytical reasoning involves the ability to look at information, be it\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, and discern patterns within the information. It’s a process\nthat includes understanding a system of relationships and draw logical conclusions about those\nrelationships.\nMultiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions are a form of assessment where respondents\nare asked to select the best possible answer (or answers) out of the choices from a list. They are\ncommon in standardized tests, quizzes, and surveys.\nData To Text Data-to-text refers to human-readable textual summaries from source data. These\ncould be used for generating reports, explanations, or narratives from structured data.\nFermiFermi problems are estimation problems which seek quick, rough estimates of quantities\nwhich can be difficult to measure. Named after physicist Enrico Fermi, these problems often require\nmaking justified guesses or assumptions to reach a solution.\nCoding Coding involves writing code following instructions, understanding code, debugging code,\ntracing or writing test cases.\nText Extraction Text extraction is the process of retrieving relevant information from a larger text\ndocument. This can include tasks like named entity recognition, keyword extraction, or extracting\nspecific data fields from unstructured text.\nText\nOutput:"}}
