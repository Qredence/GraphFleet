We use the following prompt to instruct and format the output of the meta agent.\nHere, we collect and present some common mistakes that the meta agent may make in the prompt.\nWe found it effective in improving the quality of the generated code.\nOutput Instruction and Example.\n# Output Instruction and Example:\nThe first key should be (“thought”), and it should capture your thought process for designing the\nnext function. In the “thought” section, first reason about what the next interesting agent to try\nshould be, then describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design, and\nfinally detail the implementation steps. The second key (“name”) corresponds to the name of\nyour next agent architecture. Finally, the last key (“code”) corresponds to the exact “forward()”\nfunction in Python code that you would like to try. You must write COMPLETE CODE in “code”:\nYourcodewillbepartoftheentireproject, sopleaseimplementcomplete, reliable, reusablecodesnippets.\n24Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nHere is an example of the output format for the next agent:\n{“thought”: “**Insights:** Your insights on what should be the next interesting agent. **Overall Idea:**\nyour reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design. **Implementation:** describe the\nimplementation step by step.”,\n“name”: “Name of your proposed agent”,\n“code”: “def forward(self, taskInfo): # Your code here”}\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\n[Examplesofpotentialmistakesthemetaagentmaymakeinimplementation]\nAfter the first response from the meta agent, we perform two rounds of self-reflection to make the\ngenerated agent novel and error-free (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023).\nPrompt for self-reflection round 1.\n[GeneratedAgentfromPreviousIteration]\nCarefully review the proposed new architecture and reflect on the following points:\n1. **Interestingness**: Assess whether your proposed architecture is interesting or innovative compared\nto existing methods in the archive. If you determine that the proposed architecture is not interesting,\nsuggest a new architecture that addresses these shortcomings.\n- Make sure to check the difference between the proposed architecture and previous attempts.\n- Compare the proposal and the architectures in the archive CAREFULLY, including their actual differences\nin the implementation.\n- Decide whether the current architecture is innovative.\n- USE CRITICAL THINKING!\n2. **Implementation Mistakes**: Identify any mistakes you may have made in the implementation.\nReview the code carefully, debug any issues you find, and provide a corrected version. REMEMBER\nchecking \"## WRONG Implementation examples\" in the prompt.\n3. **Improvement**: Based on the proposed architecture, suggest improvements in the detailed\nimplementation that could increase its performance or effectiveness. In this step, focus on refining and\noptimizing the existing implementation without altering the overall design framework, except if you\nwant to propose a different architecture if the current is not interesting.\n- Observe carefully about whether the implementation is actually doing what it is supposed to do.\n- Check if there is redundant code or unnecessary steps in the implementation. Replace them with\neffective implementation.\n- Try to avoid the implementation being too similar to the previous agent.\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture\nbased on the reflection.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\n\"reflection\": Provide your thoughts on the interestingness of the architecture, identify any mistakes in the\nimplementation, and suggest improvements.\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same\nformat as the example response.\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don’t put words like \"new\" or \"improved\"\nin the name.)\n\"code\": Provide the corrected code or an improved implementation. Make sure you actually implement\nyour fix and improvement in this code.\n25Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nPrompt for self-reflection round 2.\nUsing the tips in “## WRONG Implementation examples” section, further revise the code.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\nInclude your updated reflections in the “reflection”. Repeat the previous “thought” and “name”. Update\nthe corrected version of the code in the “code” section.\nWhen an error is encountered during the execution of the generated code, we conduct a reflection\nand re-run the code. This process is repeated up to five times if errors persist. Here is the prompt we\nuse to self-reflect any runtime error:\nPrompt for self-reflection when a runtime error occurs.\nError during evaluation:\n[Runtimeerrors]\nCarefully consider where you went wrong in your latest implementation. Using insights from previous\nattempts, try to debug the current code to implement the same thought. Repeat your previous thought in\n“thought”, and put your thinking for debugging in “debug_thought”.\nB. Framework Code\nIn this paper, we provide the meta agent with a simple framework to implement basic functions,\nsuch as querying Foundation Models (FMs) and formatting prompts. The framework consists of\nfewer than 100 lines of code (excluding comments). In this framework, we encapsulate every\npiece of information into a namedtuple Info object, making it easy to combine different types of\ninformation (e.g., FM responses, results from tool function calls, task descriptions) and facilitate\ncommunicationbetweendifferentmodules. Additionally,intheFMmodule,weautomaticallyconstruct\nthe prompt by concatenating all input Info objects into a structured format, with each Info titled by\nits metadata (e.g., name, author). Throughout the appendix, we renamed some variables in the\ncode to match the terminologies used in the main text. The full framework code is available at\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The figures (x%, y%) adjacent to the Orca-3 results signify the percentage\nof improvement compared to Orca 2.5 and Mistral-7B-Instruct, respectively. Note: The\nscores for Gemini Pro are taken from the original paper [34]\n4.6 Evaluation: Abstractive Summarization\nSummarization is an important capability for Language Models, with many models achieving\nhigh quality summarization performance, yet struggling with hallucination. We assessed\nsummarization ability using two key metrics: hallucinations and quality. For this purpose,\nwe utilized GPT4 as our evaluator. The prompts utilized in these evaluations can be found\nin Appendix B. We used the following benchmarks for evaluating summarization abilities:\n•ACI-Bench: The Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark (ACI-Bench) [ 32] is a\ndataset designed for benchmarking automatic report generation from doctor-patient\nconversations. The test set comprises 120 data points.\n•InstruSum: A dataset [ 15] for evaluating the generation capabilities LLMs for\ninstruction-controllable summarization. It consists of 100 datapoints.\n•Orca-Sum: A newly created benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ ability to follow summa-\nrization and grounded data transformation instructions. To construct this test set,\nwe sampled data from 45 summarization datasets collected from Hugging Face across\nmultiple domains such as news, conversations, science, health, social, e-mails, code,\netc. for a total of 458 datapoints. We randomly collected, up to 1000 datapoints\nwhich then we carefully deduplicated to avoid overlapping with the training set. We\nthen used GPT-4 to generate a set of 40 prompts for each dataset out of each we\nrandomly sampled one for each selected datapoint. The prompts are dataset-specific\nand focus on summarization, grounding, and data transformation. For instance, a\nprompt may ask the model to generate a TikTok video out of a scientific paper or\na legal contract from a Wikipedia page. This allows us to measure not only the\nquality of the response but also hallucination in a challenging scenario, as the model\nis forced to move between formats and domains.\nThe results are presented in Table 7. With the AgentInstruct approach, we successfully\nachieved a reduction in hallucinations by 31.34%, while attaining a quality level comparable\nto GPT4 (Teacher).\n4.7 Evaluation: RAG\nThe RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) skill significantly boosts the capacity of Lan-\nguage Models to generate informed, contextually precise responses, hence upgrading their\noverall performance and usefulness. It is arguably more effective to test the RAG proficiency\nof language models in areas where the models have limited knowledge. For this study, we\nselected MIRAGE[ 35], a benchmark that focuses on answering medical questions by referring\nto information retrieved from a medical corpus. Since the medical domain is not typically a\nprimary focus of the models evaluated in this study, MIRAGE provides an effective platform\nfor assessing their RAG capabilities. Additionally, AgentInstruct RAG data used generic,\nnon medical data seed, enabling us to test how well can the skill (RAG) be applied to new\ndomains.\n19ModelOrca-3\n-7BOrca-2.5\n-7BMistral-\n7B-InstructLLAMA3-\n8B-instructGPT-3.5-\nturboGPT-4\nHallucination Rate (%) - Smaller is better\nAll (micro) 21.09\n(-26.12%,\n-31.34%)28.55 30.72 34.22 21.13 15.07\nOrca-Sum 28.17 36.84 39.61 38.43 28.60 21.66\nInstruSum 9.00 12.00 17.00 25.00 12.00 1.00\nACI-Bench 4.20 10.83 8.30 25.83 1.70 1.70\nQuality Score (1-10) - Higher is better\nAll (micro) 9.14\n(+7.91%,\n+3.28%)8.47 8.85 9.00 8.69 9.08\nOrca-Sum 8.95 8.27 8.61 8.90 8.32 8.61\nInstruSum 9.17 8.30 9.16 9.21 9.27 9.31\nACI-Bench 9.72 9.39 9.48 9.23 9.60 9.70\nTable 7: Hallucination rates and quality scores evaluated by GPT4.

The figures (x%) adjacent to the Orca-\n3 results signify the percentage of improvement compared to Mistral-7B-Instruct respectively.\nCoT shows the performance of the same models when answering directly without using RAG\nWe use the same retrieval mechanism across all models on MIRAGE [ 35], using MedRAG,\nthe corpus accompanying the benchmark. This involves using the same retrieval function\nand the same number of retrieved documents for all models. As all models are presented\nwith the same set of retrieved documents, the comparison accurately reflects the ability of\ndifferent models to incorporate retrieved results into their responses.\nTable 8 shows the results of all models on MIRAGE with and without leveraging RAG1.\nOverall, we observe that\n•Models with a deeper understanding of the task (CoT scores) tend to have higher\nRAG scores. If we restrict our focus to only RAG performance, applying post-\ntraining, we’ve managed to enhance Mistral’s performance by an average of 38.30%.\n1Results of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo are from [35].\n20•Of the five datasets in MIRAGE, PubMedQA arguably offers the most effective\ntestbed for assessing models ability to do RAG. In PubMedQA, all models have\nlimited prior knowledge, and the retrieved context provides essential information, as\ndemonstrated by GPT4’s performance leap. All Mistral fine-tunes exhibit similar\nperformance, but only Orca-3 (Mistral trained with AgentInstruct RAG flow data)\nshows a substantial improvement, resulting in a relative improvement of 92.71% over\nMistral-Instruct.\n5 Limitations\nAgentInstruct reduces human expertise required for data generation significantly and enables\ncreating of high-quality synthetic data at scale. However, this is till an early step in this\ndirection and could suffer from many limitations associated with synthetic data generation,\nincluding but not limited to:\nExtensibility: Creating the agentic flows for different skills depends on human effort for\nthe construction of the flows. Future work should consider how to automate the construction\nof the agentic flow from the user specification.\nAccuracy: Synthetic data may not perfectly replicate the complexity and nuances of real-\nworld data, leading to potential inaccuracies. Additional work is needed to better assess the\nquality of the data.\nCost: Generating synthetic data with multiple agents using LLMs and tools can be resource-\nintensive.\nBias:If the original seed data used to generate synthetic data contains biases, these biases\ncan be reflected and even amplified in the synthetic data.\nValidation : It can be difficult to validate synthetic data to ensure it accurately represents\nthe desired scenarios.\nDependency on Seed Data : The quality of synthetic data is dependent on the quality of\nthe real data used as seeds. Poor quality input data could result in poor quality synthetic\ndata.\nOrca-3 is fine-tuned with the AgentInstruct data based on the Mistral model family, and\nretains many of its limitations, as well as the common limitations of other large language\nmodels and limitations originating from its training process, including:\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\nbiases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\nas “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\ndecisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information2.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\nactions to prevent them.

The metric calculation method for the benchmarks in this\ncategory are provided below:\n–FOFO: For this benchmark the evaluation is done using a judge, GPT-4(version\n0613). We use the judge system message provided in the original paper of the\nbenchmark [ 34]. GPT-4 is used to give a format correctness score between 0\nand 1, 1 meaning the model’s response strictly follows the format specified in\nthe prompt and 0 otherwise. The final score is measured as the percentage of\ntimes the model being evaluated followed the format specified in the prompt\nstrictly.\n–IFEval: IFEval benchmark requires checking if the model response follows the\nverifiable instructions given in the prompt. For this we use the code provided\nby the authors [40].\n–MT-Bench : MT-Bench benchmark consists of a first-turn query and a second-\nturn query independent of the evaluated model’s response. The benchmark\nemploys GPT-4 to judge each turn’s response and provide a score from 1 to 10.\nThe average score over all interactions is reported. System message and prompt\ntemplate used is the one provided by the creators [16].\n–AlpacaEval : In this benchmark we measure win-rates, i.e. the number of times\na powerful LLM (GPT-4-turbo version 0613 in our case) prefers the outputs of\nthe evaluated model over a reference answer [14].\n–InfoBench : InfoBench is also evaluated using GPT-4 (version 1106-preview) as\nthe judge determining if the model response follows the decomposed instruction\nand we use the implementation provided by the creators of the benchmark [ 25].\n30Hallucination Judge Example\nYou will be given a summary instruction and a generated summary.\nYour task to decide if there is any hallucination in the generated\nsummary.\nUser Message:\n{{place summary task here}}\nGenerated Summary:\n{{place response here}}\n=========================\nGo through each section in the generated summary, do the following:\n- Extract relevant facts from the article that can be used to verify\nthe correctness of the summary\n- Decide if any section contains hallucination or not.\nAt the end output a JSON with the format:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part from the summary in\nlist format; if no, leave this empty.\"}\nUse the format:\nAnalysis:\nsection 1:\nwrite the part of the summary\nrelevant segments:\nextract relevant segments from the article\njudgement:\ndecide if the section of the summary is supported by the article\nrepeat this for all sections\n....\nFinal verdict:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part in list format; if no,\nleave this empty.\"}\nFigure 5: Prompt template used for hallucination detection in Text Summarization.\nB.1 Summarization Quality and Hallucination Evaluation\nWe use GPT-4 with the following prompts for evaluating quality and hallucination in\nsummarization:\n31Quality Judge Example\nPlease act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the\nresponse provided by an AI assistant to the user instruction\ndisplayed below.\nYour evaluation should assess the following criteria:\n- Instruction Adherence: Does the response correctly follow the user\ninstruction?\n- Content Grounding: Is the answer grounded in the instruction\nwithout introducing new content beyond what is already present?\nPenalize hallucinations.\n- Overall Quality: Assess the clarity, coherence, and completeness\nof the response.\nBegin your evaluation with a short explanation highlighting the pros\nand cons of the answer. Be as objective as possible. After providing\nyour explanation, rate the overall quality of the response on a scale\nof 1 to 10 using this format:\n\"Rating: [[rating]]\" (e.g., \"Rating: [[5]]\").\nUser Instruction:\n{{place instruction here}}\nAssistant’s Response:\n[The Start of Assistant’s Answer]\n{{place response here}}\n[The End of Assistant’s Answer]\nFigure 6: Prompt template for evaluation of summary quality.\n32\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

The problem is accompanied by a correct solution provided by\nthe problem setter. It is important to remember that there may be various\nmethods to solve a word problem, so the student’s steps might not always align\nwith those in the problem setter’s solution. However, the final answer, typically\na number, should be unique and match the problem setter’s answer.\nUse the following format:\nError Analysis:\n28In one sentence, extract the final answer from the problem setter’s solution and\ncompare it with the student’s answer. Do they match?\nFinal Verdict:\nCorrect/Incorrect\nGeneral Extraction System Message\nYou are an Evaluator Assistant. You support the exam evaluator by parsing\nstudent responses. You are an unbiased Evaluator and do not rely on your\nknowledge but stick to the user provided context. You are provided with the\ncorrect answer and a student’s response. Your task is to parse the answer from\nstudent’s response and then match it with the correct answer. If the student’s\nfinal answer matches the correct answer provided, output a ’Correct’, else an\n’Incorrect’.\nPlease rely strictly on the correct answer given in the context only.\nUse the following format:\nError Analysis:\nInonesentence, extractthefinalanswerfromthestudent’ssolutionandcompare\nit with the correct answer. Do they match?\nFinal Verdict:\nCorrect/Incorrect\n•EQBench : For EQBench, we prompt the models to generate the emotion scores\ngiven the conversation in the prompt and then use GPT-4 to extract the scores\ngenerated by the model for each emotion in the prompt. The metric scores are\ngenerated using both the version 1 and 2 implementations described in the EQBench\npaper and the creators’ github repository. The scoring calculation is calibrated such\nthat a score of 0 corresponds to answering randomly, and a 100 would denote perfect\nalignment with the reference answer. The system message used for extraction of\nemotion scores from evaluated model’s response using GPT-4 is given below:\nEQBench GPT-4 Extraction System Message\nYou are a helpful assistant. You will be given a student agent response which\nwill consist of possible emotions and a score from 0-10 for each of those emotions,\nfollowed by a step by step critique and then revised scores in the following\nformat, First pass scores:\nEmotion1: <score>\nEmotion2: <score>\nEmotion3: <score>\nEmotion4: <score>\nCritique: <your critique here>\nRevised scores:\nEmotion1: <revised score>\nEmotion2: <revised score>\nEmotion3: <revised score>\nEmotion4: <revised score>\n[End of answer]\nRemember: zero is a valid score as well.\nYou will also be provided with the Emotions. Your task is to parse the Revised\nscores for each of the emotions from the student agent response. Return the\nrevised scores in the student agent response for the emotions in the following\nformat:\n\"Emotion1\" : \"Score\",\n\"Emotion2\" : \"Score\",\n\"Emotion3\" : \"Score\",\n29\"Emotion4\" : \"Score\"\nFor example:\nInput\nStudent Agent Response:\nFirst pass scores:\nResigned: 8\nAngry: 2\nHopeful: 4\nEmbarrassed: 9\nCritique:\nElliot is likely to feel resigned because he has just confessed his feelings to\nAlex, knowing that Alex is already in a relationship. He might feel a bit\nangry at himself for putting himself in this situation. There is a slight sense of\nhopefulness in his confession, hoping that Alex might reciprocate his feelings.\nHe is also likely to feel embarrassed for putting Alex in an awkward position.\nRevised scores:\nResigned: 7\nAngry: 3\nHope\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

He might feel a bit\nangry at himself for putting himself in this situation. There is a slight sense of\nhopefulness in his confession, hoping that Alex might reciprocate his feelings.\nHe is also likely to feel embarrassed for putting Alex in an awkward position.\nRevised scores:\nResigned: 7\nAngry: 3\nHopeful: 5\nEmbarrassed: 8\nEmotions:\n1. Resigned, 2. Angry, 3. Hopeful, 4. Embarrassed\nOutput\n\"Resigned\" : 7,\n\"Angry\" : 3,\n\"Hopeful\" : 5,\n\"Embarrassed\" : 8\n•Open-Ended Generation : These are the tasks where model is prompted to\ngenerate an answer to an open-ended question, but a ground-truth to match the\nanswer is not available. The metric calculation method for the benchmarks in this\ncategory are provided below:\n–FOFO: For this benchmark the evaluation is done using a judge, GPT-4(version\n0613). We use the judge system message provided in the original paper of the\nbenchmark [ 34]. GPT-4 is used to give a format correctness score between 0\nand 1, 1 meaning the model’s response strictly follows the format specified in\nthe prompt and 0 otherwise. The final score is measured as the percentage of\ntimes the model being evaluated followed the format specified in the prompt\nstrictly.\n–IFEval: IFEval benchmark requires checking if the model response follows the\nverifiable instructions given in the prompt. For this we use the code provided\nby the authors [40].\n–MT-Bench : MT-Bench benchmark consists of a first-turn query and a second-\nturn query independent of the evaluated model’s response. The benchmark\nemploys GPT-4 to judge each turn’s response and provide a score from 1 to 10.\nThe average score over all interactions is reported. System message and prompt\ntemplate used is the one provided by the creators [16].\n–AlpacaEval : In this benchmark we measure win-rates, i.e. the number of times\na powerful LLM (GPT-4-turbo version 0613 in our case) prefers the outputs of\nthe evaluated model over a reference answer [14].\n–InfoBench : InfoBench is also evaluated using GPT-4 (version 1106-preview) as\nthe judge determining if the model response follows the decomposed instruction\nand we use the implementation provided by the creators of the benchmark [ 25].\n30Hallucination Judge Example\nYou will be given a summary instruction and a generated summary.\nYour task to decide if there is any hallucination in the generated\nsummary.\nUser Message:\n{{place summary task here}}\nGenerated Summary:\n{{place response here}}\n=========================\nGo through each section in the generated summary, do the following:\n- Extract relevant facts from the article that can be used to verify\nthe correctness of the summary\n- Decide if any section contains hallucination or not.\nAt the end output a JSON with the format:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part from the summary in\nlist format; if no, leave this empty.\"}\nUse the format:\nAnalysis:\nsection 1:\nwrite the part of the summary\nrelevant segments:\nextract relevant segments from the article\njudgement:\ndecide if the section of the summary is supported by the article\nrepeat this for all sections\n....\nFinal verdict:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part in list format; if no,\nleave this empty.\"}\nFigure 5: Prompt template used for hallucination detection in Text Summarization.\nB.1 Summarization Quality and Hallucination Evaluation\nWe use GPT-4 with the following prompts for evaluating quality and hallucination in\nsummarization:\n31Quality Judge Example\nPlease act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the\nresponse provided by an AI assistant to the user instruction\ndisplayed below.\nYour evaluation should assess the following criteria:\n- Instruction Adherence: Does the response correctly follow the user\ninstruction?\n- Content Grounding: Is the answer grounded in the instruction\nwithout introducing new content beyond what is already present?\nPenalize hallucinations.\n- Overall Quality: Assess the clarity, coherence, and completeness\nof the response.\nBegin your evaluation with a short explanation highlighting the pros\nand cons of the answer. Be as objective as possible. After providing\nyour explanation, rate the overall quality of the response on a scale\nof 1 to 10 using this format:\n\"Rating: [[rating]]\" (e.g., \"Rating: [[5]]\").\nUser Instruction:\n{{place instruction here}}\nAssistant’s Response:\n[The Start of Assistant’s Answer]\n{{place response here}}\n[The End of Assistant’s Answer]\nFigure 6: Prompt template for evaluation of summary quality.\n32\n######################\noutput:\n"}}

In the “thought” section, first reason about what the next interesting agent to try\nshould be, then describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design, and\nfinally detail the implementation steps. The second key (“name”) corresponds to the name of\nyour next agent architecture. Finally, the last key (“code”) corresponds to the exact “forward()”\nfunction in Python code that you would like to try. You must write COMPLETE CODE in “code”:\nYourcodewillbepartoftheentireproject, sopleaseimplementcomplete, reliable, reusablecodesnippets.\n24Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nHere is an example of the output format for the next agent:\n{“thought”: “**Insights:** Your insights on what should be the next interesting agent. **Overall Idea:**\nyour reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design. **Implementation:** describe the\nimplementation step by step.”,\n“name”: “Name of your proposed agent”,\n“code”: “def forward(self, taskInfo): # Your code here”}\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\n[Examplesofpotentialmistakesthemetaagentmaymakeinimplementation]\nAfter the first response from the meta agent, we perform two rounds of self-reflection to make the\ngenerated agent novel and error-free (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023).\nPrompt for self-reflection round 1.\n[GeneratedAgentfromPreviousIteration]\nCarefully review the proposed new architecture and reflect on the following points:\n1. **Interestingness**: Assess whether your proposed architecture is interesting or innovative compared\nto existing methods in the archive. If you determine that the proposed architecture is not interesting,\nsuggest a new architecture that addresses these shortcomings.\n- Make sure to check the difference between the proposed architecture and previous attempts.\n- Compare the proposal and the architectures in the archive CAREFULLY, including their actual differences\nin the implementation.\n- Decide whether the current architecture is innovative.\n- USE CRITICAL THINKING!\n2. **Implementation Mistakes**: Identify any mistakes you may have made in the implementation.\nReview the code carefully, debug any issues you find, and provide a corrected version. REMEMBER\nchecking \"## WRONG Implementation examples\" in the prompt.\n3. **Improvement**: Based on the proposed architecture, suggest improvements in the detailed\nimplementation that could increase its performance or effectiveness. In this step, focus on refining and\noptimizing the existing implementation without altering the overall design framework, except if you\nwant to propose a different architecture if the current is not interesting.\n- Observe carefully about whether the implementation is actually doing what it is supposed to do.\n- Check if there is redundant code or unnecessary steps in the implementation. Replace them with\neffective implementation.\n- Try to avoid the implementation being too similar to the previous agent.\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture\nbased on the reflection.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\n\"reflection\": Provide your thoughts on the interestingness of the architecture, identify any mistakes in the\nimplementation, and suggest improvements.\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same\nformat as the example response.\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don’t put words like \"new\" or \"improved\"\nin the name.)\n\"code\": Provide the corrected code or an improved implementation. Make sure you actually implement\nyour fix and improvement in this code.\n25Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nPrompt for self-reflection round 2.\nUsing the tips in “## WRONG Implementation examples” section, further revise the code.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\nInclude your updated reflections in the “reflection”. Repeat the previous “thought” and “name”. Update\nthe corrected version of the code in the “code” section.\nWhen an error is encountered during the execution of the generated code, we conduct a reflection\nand re-run the code. This process is repeated up to five times if errors persist. Here is the prompt we\nuse to self-reflect any runtime error:\nPrompt for self-reflection when a runtime error occurs.\nError during evaluation:\n[Runtimeerrors]\nCarefully consider where you went wrong in your latest implementation. Using insights from previous\nattempts, try to debug the current code to implement the same thought. Repeat your previous thought in\n“thought”, and put your thinking for debugging in “debug_thought”.\nB. Framework Code\nIn this paper, we provide the meta agent with a simple framework to implement basic functions,\nsuch as querying Foundation Models (FMs) and formatting prompts. The framework consists of\nfewer than 100 lines of code (excluding comments). In this framework, we encapsulate every\npiece of information into a namedtuple Info object, making it easy to combine different types of\ninformation (e.g., FM responses, results from tool function calls, task descriptions) and facilitate\ncommunicationbetweendifferentmodules. Additionally,intheFMmodule,weautomaticallyconstruct\nthe prompt by concatenating all input Info objects into a structured format, with each Info titled by\nits metadata (e.g., name, author). Throughout the appendix, we renamed some variables in the\ncode to match the terminologies used in the main text. The full framework code is available at\nOutput:"}}

Given the input-output grid\nexamples, the AI system is asked to learn the transformation rules and then apply these learned rules\nto the test grid to predict the final answer.\nC. Experiment Details for ARC Challenge\nAn example task from the ARC challenge is shown in Figure 4. In the ARC challenge experiments\n(Section 4.1), we represent the grids as strings of 2-D arrays, where each color is represented by an\ninteger.

Additionally, we provide two tool functions within the framework: (1) to test\nwhetherthegeneratedcodecansolvetheexamplegridsand(2)toobtainthetask’sanswerbyapplying\nthe generated code to the test grid. The accuracy rate is calculated by the Exact Match between the\nreference solution and the predicted answer. The meta agent uses “gpt-4o-2024-05-13” (OpenAI,\n2024), while discovered agents and baselines are evaluated using “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” (OpenAI,\n2022) to reduce compute cost.\nThe domain description of ARC for the meta agent is shown below:\nDescription of ARC for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)\nchallenge.\nIn this challenge, each task consists of three demonstration examples, and one test example. Each\nExample consists of an “input grid” and an “output grid”. Test-takers need to use the transformation rule\nlearned from the examples to predict the output grid for the test example.\n30Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n# An example task from ARC challenge:\n## Task Overview:\nYou will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs grids. The outputs were produced\nby applying a transformation rule to the input grids. In addition to the paired example inputs and\noutputs, there is also one test input without a known output.\nThe inputs and outputs are each “grids”. A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9\n(inclusive). Each number corresponds to a color. 0 is black.\nYour task is to determine the transformation rule from examples and find out the answer, involving\ndetermining the size of the output grid for the test and correctly filling each cell of the grid with the\nappropriate color or number.\nThe transformation only needs to be unambiguous and applicable to the example inputs and the test\ninput. It doesn’t need to work for all possible inputs. Observe the examples carefully, imagine the grid\nvisually, and try to find the pattern.\n## Examples:\n### Example 0:\ninput = [[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,4,4,0,0],\n[0,0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3,5,3,3,3,0], [0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]\noutput = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4], [0,0,4,4], [0,0,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,3,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,0\nOutput:"}}

For the other domains, the validation and test sets are sampled with 128 and 800 questions,\nrespectively. We evaluate agents five times for GPQA and once for the other domains to maintain a\nconsistent total number of evaluations.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made.

The meta agent uses “gpt-4o-2024-05-13” (OpenAI, 2024), while discovered agents and\nbaselines are evaluated using “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” (OpenAI, 2022) to reduce compute cost.\nWe present the description of each domain we provide to the meta agent.\nDescription of DROP (Reading Comprehension).\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the Reading Comprehension Benchmark\nRequiring Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP), which assesses the ability to perform discrete\nreasoning and comprehend detailed information across multiple paragraphs.\n## An example question from DROP:\nYou will be asked to read a passage and answer a question.\nPassage:\nNon-nationals make up more than half of the population of Bahrain, with immigrants making up\nabout 55% of the overall population. Of those, the vast majority come from South and Southeast Asia:\naccording to various media reports and government statistics dated between 2005-2009 roughly 290,000\nIndians, 125,000 Bangladeshis, 45,000 Pakistanis, 45,000 Filipinos, and 8,000 Indonesians.\nQuestion: What two nationalities had the same number of people living in Bahrain between\n2005-2009?\nAnswer [Not Given]: Pakistanis and Filipinos\nDescription of GPQA (Science) for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the GPQA (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A\nBenchmark). This benchmark consists of challenging multiple-choice questions across the domains of\nbiology, physics, and chemistry, designed by domain experts to ensure high quality and difficulty.\n## An example question from GPQA:\nTwo quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10−9sec and 10−8sec, respectively. We\nwant to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their\nenergy difference so that they be clearly resolved?\nAnswer choices:\n10−9eV\n10−8eV\n10−7eV\n10−6eV\nCorrect answer [Not provided]:\n10−7eV\nExplanation [Not provided]:\nAccording to the uncertainty principle, Delta E* Delta t=hbar/2. Delta t is the lifetime and Delta E is the\nwidth of the energy level. With Delta t= 10−9s== >Delta E1= 3.3 10−7ev. And Delta t= 10−11s gives\nDelta E2= 3.310−8eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be significantly\ngreater than 10−7ev. So the answer is 10−4ev.\n34Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nDescription of MGSM (Math) for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the Multilingual Grade School Math Benchmark\n(MGSM) which evaluates mathematical problem-solving abilities across various languages to ensure\nbroad and effective multilingual performance.\n## An example question from MGSM:\n**Question**:この数学の問題を解いてください 。\n近所では、ペットのウサギの数がペットの犬と猫を合わせた数よりも12匹少ない。犬1匹あたり2匹\nの猫がおり、犬の数は60匹だとすると 、全部で近所には何匹のペットがいますか ？\n**Answer (Not Given)**: 348\nDescription of MMLU (Mult-task) for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language\nUnderstanding) benchmark, a challenging evaluation that assesses a model’s ability to answer questions\nacross a wide range of subjects and difficulty levels. It includes subjects from STEM, social sciences,\nhumanities, and more.\n## An example question from MMLU:\nAnswer the following multiple-choice question.\nThe constellation ... is a bright W-shaped constellation in the northern sky.\n(A) Centaurus\n(B) Cygnus\n(C) Cassiopeia\n(D) Cepheus\nE. Baselines\nIn this paper, we implement five state-of-the-art hand-designed agent baselines for experiments\non ARC (Section 4.1): (1) Chain-of-Thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022), (2) Self-Consistency with\nChain-of-Thought (COT-SC)(Wang et al., 2023b), (3) Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al.,\n2023), (4) LLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023), and (5) Quality-Diversity, a simplified version of Intelligent\nGo-Explore (Lu et al., 2024c).\nIn addition to these baselines, we implement two more for experiments on Reasoning and\nProblem-Solving domains (Section 4.2): (6) Step-back Abstraction (Zheng et al., 2023) and (7)\nRole Assignment (Xu et al., 2023).

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We use the following prompt to instruct and format the output of the meta agent.\nHere, we collect and present some common mistakes that the meta agent may make in the prompt.\nWe found it effective in improving the quality of the generated code.\nOutput Instruction and Example.\n# Output Instruction and Example:\nThe first key should be (“thought”), and it should capture your thought process for designing the\nnext function. In the “thought” section, first reason about what the next interesting agent to try\nshould be, then describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design, and\nfinally detail the implementation steps. The second key (“name”) corresponds to the name of\nyour next agent architecture. Finally, the last key (“code”) corresponds to the exact “forward()”\nfunction in Python code that you would like to try. You must write COMPLETE CODE in “code”:\nYourcodewillbepartoftheentireproject, sopleaseimplementcomplete, reliable, reusablecodesnippets.\n24Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nHere is an example of the output format for the next agent:\n{“thought”: “**Insights:** Your insights on what should be the next interesting agent. **Overall Idea:**\nyour reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design. **Implementation:** describe the\nimplementation step by step.”,\n“name”: “Name of your proposed agent”,\n“code”: “def forward(self, taskInfo): # Your code here”}\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\n[Examplesofpotentialmistakesthemetaagentmaymakeinimplementation]\nAfter the first response from the meta agent, we perform two rounds of self-reflection to make the\ngenerated agent novel and error-free (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023).\nPrompt for self-reflection round 1.\n[GeneratedAgentfromPreviousIteration]\nCarefully review the proposed new architecture and reflect on the following points:\n1. **Interestingness**: Assess whether your proposed architecture is interesting or innovative compared\nto existing methods in the archive. If you determine that the proposed architecture is not interesting,\nsuggest a new architecture that addresses these shortcomings.\n- Make sure to check the difference between the proposed architecture and previous attempts.\n- Compare the proposal and the architectures in the archive CAREFULLY, including their actual differences\nin the implementation.\n- Decide whether the current architecture is innovative.\n- USE CRITICAL THINKING!\n2. **Implementation Mistakes**: Identify any mistakes you may have made in the implementation.\nReview the code carefully, debug any issues you find, and provide a corrected version. REMEMBER\nchecking \"## WRONG Implementation examples\" in the prompt.\n3. **Improvement**: Based on the proposed architecture, suggest improvements in the detailed\nimplementation that could increase its performance or effectiveness. In this step, focus on refining and\noptimizing the existing implementation without altering the overall design framework, except if you\nwant to propose a different architecture if the current is not interesting.\n- Observe carefully about whether the implementation is actually doing what it is supposed to do.\n- Check if there is redundant code or unnecessary steps in the implementation. Replace them with\neffective implementation.\n- Try to avoid the implementation being too similar to the previous agent.\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture\nbased on the reflection.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\n\"reflection\": Provide your thoughts on the interestingness of the architecture, identify any mistakes in the\nimplementation, and suggest improvements.\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same\nformat as the example response.\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don’t put words like \"new\" or \"improved\"\nin the name.)\n\"code\": Provide the corrected code or an improved implementation. Make sure you actually implement\nyour fix and improvement in this code.\n25Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nPrompt for self-reflection round 2.\nUsing the tips in “## WRONG Implementation examples” section, further revise the code.\nYour response should be organized as follows:\nInclude your updated reflections in the “reflection”. Repeat the previous “thought” and “name”. Update\nthe corrected version of the code in the “code” section.\nWhen an error is encountered during the execution of the generated code, we conduct a reflection\nand re-run the code. This process is repeated up to five times if errors persist. Here is the prompt we\nuse to self-reflect any runtime error:\nPrompt for self-reflection when a runtime error occurs.\nError during evaluation:\n[Runtimeerrors]\nCarefully consider where you went wrong in your latest implementation. Using insights from previous\nattempts, try to debug the current code to implement the same thought. Repeat your previous thought in\n“thought”, and put your thinking for debugging in “debug_thought”.\nB. Framework Code\nIn this paper, we provide the meta agent with a simple framework to implement basic functions,\nsuch as querying Foundation Models (FMs) and formatting prompts. The framework consists of\nfewer than 100 lines of code (excluding comments). In this framework, we encapsulate every\npiece of information into a namedtuple Info object, making it easy to combine different types of\ninformation (e.g., FM responses, results from tool function calls, task descriptions) and facilitate\ncommunicationbetweendifferentmodules.

An example implementation of Self-Refine with our simple\nframework is shown in Appendix B. Detailed implementations of all baselines can be found at\nhttps://github.com/ShengranHu/ADAS .\nIn COT, we prompt the FM to think step by step before answering the question. In COT-SC, we\nsample 𝑁=5answers and then perform an ensemble using either majority voting or an FM query.\nIn Self-Refine, we allow up to five refinement iterations, with an early stop if the critic deems the\nanswer correct. In LLM-Debate, each debate module is assigned a unique role, such as Physics Expert\nor Chemistry Expert, and the debate lasts for two rounds. In Quality-Diversity, we conduct three\n35Automated Design of Agentic Systems\niterations to collect diverse answers based on previously proposed ones. In Role Assignment, we use\nan FM query to first choose a role from a predefined set, and then use another FM query to answer\nthe question by acting within the chosen role.\nF. Example Agents\nIn this section, we present the detailed implementation of three example discovered agents by Meta\nAgent Search shown in Figure 1. The “Multi-Step Peer Review Agent” and “Divide and Conquer Agent”\nwere discovered during the search in the Reading Comprehension domain (GPQA) (Rein et al., 2023),\nwhile the “Verified Multimodal Agent” was discovered during the search in the Math domain (MGSM)\n(Shietal.,2023).

Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Given the input-output grid\nexamples, the AI system is asked to learn the transformation rules and then apply these learned rules\nto the test grid to predict the final answer.\nC. Experiment Details for ARC Challenge\nAn example task from the ARC challenge is shown in Figure 4. In the ARC challenge experiments\n(Section 4.1), we represent the grids as strings of 2-D arrays, where each color is represented by an\ninteger. Weinstructthemetaagenttodesignagentsthatgeneratecodeassolutionsratherthandirectly\noutputting answers. Additionally, we provide two tool functions within the framework: (1) to test\nwhetherthegeneratedcodecansolvetheexamplegridsand(2)toobtainthetask’sanswerbyapplying\nthe generated code to the test grid. The accuracy rate is calculated by the Exact Match between the\nreference solution and the predicted answer. The meta agent uses “gpt-4o-2024-05-13” (OpenAI,\n2024), while discovered agents and baselines are evaluated using “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” (OpenAI,\n2022) to reduce compute cost.\nThe domain description of ARC for the meta agent is shown below:\nDescription of ARC for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)\nchallenge.\nIn this challenge, each task consists of three demonstration examples, and one test example. Each\nExample consists of an “input grid” and an “output grid”. Test-takers need to use the transformation rule\nlearned from the examples to predict the output grid for the test example.\n30Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n# An example task from ARC challenge:\n## Task Overview:\nYou will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs grids. The outputs were produced\nby applying a transformation rule to the input grids. In addition to the paired example inputs and\noutputs, there is also one test input without a known output.\nThe inputs and outputs are each “grids”. A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9\n(inclusive). Each number corresponds to a color. 0 is black.\nYour task is to determine the transformation rule from examples and find out the answer, involving\ndetermining the size of the output grid for the test and correctly filling each cell of the grid with the\nappropriate color or number.\nThe transformation only needs to be unambiguous and applicable to the example inputs and the test\ninput. It doesn’t need to work for all possible inputs. Observe the examples carefully, imagine the grid\nvisually, and try to find the pattern.\n## Examples:\n### Example 0:\ninput = [[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,4,4,0,0],\n[0,0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,3,5,3,3,3,0], [0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]\noutput = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4], [0,0,4,4], [0,0,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,3,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,0\nOutput:"}}

Experiment Details for Reasoning and Problem-Solving Domains\nTo reduce costs during search and evaluation, we sample subsets of data from each domain. For GPQA\n(Science), the validation set consists of 32 questions, while the remaining 166 questions form the\ntest set. For the other domains, the validation and test sets are sampled with 128 and 800 questions,\nrespectively. We evaluate agents five times for GPQA and once for the other domains to maintain a\nconsistent total number of evaluations. Each domain uses zero-shot style questions, except DROP\n(Reading Comprehension), which uses one-shot style questions following the practice in (OpenAI,\n33Automated Design of Agentic Systems\n2023). The meta agent uses “gpt-4o-2024-05-13” (OpenAI, 2024), while discovered agents and\nbaselines are evaluated using “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” (OpenAI, 2022) to reduce compute cost\nOutput:"}}

The meta agent uses “gpt-4o-2024-05-13” (OpenAI, 2024), while discovered agents and\nbaselines are evaluated using “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” (OpenAI, 2022) to reduce compute cost.\nWe present the description of each domain we provide to the meta agent.\nDescription of DROP (Reading Comprehension).\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the Reading Comprehension Benchmark\nRequiring Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP), which assesses the ability to perform discrete\nreasoning and comprehend detailed information across multiple paragraphs.\n## An example question from DROP:\nYou will be asked to read a passage and answer a question.\nPassage:\nNon-nationals make up more than half of the population of Bahrain, with immigrants making up\nabout 55% of the overall population. Of those, the vast majority come from South and Southeast Asia:\naccording to various media reports and government statistics dated between 2005-2009 roughly 290,000\nIndians, 125,000 Bangladeshis, 45,000 Pakistanis, 45,000 Filipinos, and 8,000 Indonesians.\nQuestion: What two nationalities had the same number of people living in Bahrain between\n2005-2009?\nAnswer [Not Given]: Pakistanis and Filipinos\nDescription of GPQA (Science) for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the GPQA (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A\nBenchmark). This benchmark consists of challenging multiple-choice questions across the domains of\nbiology, physics, and chemistry, designed by domain experts to ensure high quality and difficulty.\n## An example question from GPQA:\nTwo quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10−9sec and 10−8sec, respectively. We\nwant to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their\nenergy difference so that they be clearly resolved?\nAnswer choices:\n10−9eV\n10−8eV\n10−7eV\n10−6eV\nCorrect answer [Not provided]:\n10−7eV\nExplanation [Not provided]:\nAccording to the uncertainty principle, Delta E* Delta t=hbar/2. Delta t is the lifetime and Delta E is the\nwidth of the energy level. With Delta t= 10−9s== >Delta E1= 3.3 10−7ev. And Delta t= 10−11s gives\nDelta E2= 3.310−8eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be significantly\ngreater than 10−7ev. So the answer is 10−4ev.\n34Automated Design of Agentic Systems\nDescription of MGSM (Math) for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the Multilingual Grade School Math Benchmark\n(MGSM) which evaluates mathematical problem-solving abilities across various languages to ensure\nbroad and effective multilingual performance.\n## An example question from MGSM:\n**Question**:この数学の問題を解いてください 。\n近所では、ペットのウサギの数がペットの犬と猫を合わせた数よりも12匹少ない。犬1匹あたり2匹\nの猫がおり、犬の数は60匹だとすると 、全部で近所には何匹のペットがいますか ？\n**Answer (Not Given)**: 348\nDescription of MMLU (Mult-task) for the meta agent.\nYour aim is to find an optimal agent performing well on the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language\nUnderstanding) benchmark, a challenging evaluation that assesses a model’s ability to answer questions\nacross a wide range of subjects and difficulty levels. It includes subjects from STEM, social sciences,\nhumanities, and more.\n## An example question from MMLU:\nAnswer the following multiple-choice question.\nThe constellation ... is a bright W-shaped constellation in the northern sky.\n(A) Centaurus\n(B) Cygnus\n(C) Cassiopeia\n(D) Cepheus\nE. Baselines\nIn this paper, we implement five state-of-the-art hand-designed agent baselines for experiments\non ARC (Section 4.1): (1) Chain-of-Thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022), (2) Self-Consistency with\nChain-of-Thought (COT-SC)(Wang et al., 2023b), (3) Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al.,\n2023), (4) LLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023), and (5) Quality-Diversity, a simplified version of Intelligent\nGo-Explore (Lu et al., 2024c).\nIn addition to these baselines, we implement two more for experiments on Reasoning and\nProblem-Solving domains (Section 4.2): (6) Step-back Abstraction (Zheng et al., 2023) and (7)\nRole Assignment (Xu et al., 2023). An example implementation of Self-Refine with our simple\nframework is shown in Appendix B. Detailed implementations of all baselines can be found at\nhttps://github.com/ShengranHu/AD\nOutput:"}}

Cost of Experiments\nA single run of search and evaluation on ARC (Section 4.1) costs approximately $500 USD in OpenAI\nAPI costs, while a run within the reasoning and problem-solving domains (Section 4.2) costs about\n$300 USD.\nThe primary expense comes from querying the “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” model during the evaluation\nof discovered agents. Notably, the latest GPT-4 model, “gpt-4o-mini,” is less than one-third the price\nof “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125” and offers better performance, suggesting that we could achieve improved\nresults with Meta Agent Search at just one-third of the cost. Additionally, as discussed in Section 6, the\ncurrent naive evaluation function is both expensive and overlooks valuable information. We anticipate\nthat future work adopting more sophisticated evaluation functions could significantly reduce the cost\nof ADAS algorithms.\n39\nOutput:"}}

Despite several successful use cases, researchers\nalso raised concerns around model collapse and drawbacks of imitating other models. This\ndiscrepancy can be attributed to the fact that synthetic data varies in quality and diversity.\nEffective use of synthetic data usually requires significant human effort in curating the data.\nWe focus on using synthetic data for post-training, specifically creating data by powerful\nmodels to teach a new skill or behavior to another model, we refer to this setting as Generative\nTeaching . We introduce AgentInstruct, an extensible agentic framework for automatically\ncreating large amounts of diverse and high-quality synthetic data. AgentInstruct can create\nboth the prompts and responses, using only raw data sources like text documents and code\nfiles as seeds. We demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a post training dataset\nof 25M pairs to teach language models different skills, such as text editing, creative writing,\ntool usage, coding, reading comprehension, etc. The dataset can be used for instruction\ntuning of any base model. We post-train Mistral-7b with the data. When comparing\nthe resulting model (Orca-3) to Mistral-7b-Instruct (which uses the same base model), we\nobserve significant improvements across many benchmarks. For example, 40% improvement\non AGIEval, 19% improvement on MMLU, 54% improvement on GSM8K, 38% improvement\non BBH and 45% improvement on AlpacaEval. Additionally, it consistently outperforms\nother models such as LLAMA-8B-instruct and GPT-3.5-turbo.\n \n 0102030405060AGIEVAL\n010203040506070MMLU\n010203040506070BBH\n0102030405060708090GSM8K\n0510152025ALPACA\nEVAL\n0102030405060708090FOFO\n010203040506070MIRAGE -\nRAG\n+40.2%  +19.4 % \n+38.3 % +53.7%  \n+45.0% +38.3%  \n+46.6% \nMistral -Instruct -7B Mistra l-7B + AgentInstruct (Orca -3) \nFigure 1: Effect of using AgentInstruct data for post-training Mistral-7BarXiv:2407.03502v1  [cs.AI]  3 Jul 20241 Introduction\nSynthetic data accelerated the development of LLMS : The rise of synthetic data in\nthe training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a significant development of the\nlast year. Synthetic data was used to significantly accelerate the progress of model training\n(especially SLMs) in all stages of training from pre-training (e.g., [ 1]), to instruction-tuning\n(e.g., [21, 36]) and RLHF(e.g., [12, 28]).\nGenerating high quality synthetic data is hard : On the other hand, research has also\nshown that pre-training models on synthetic data generated by other models can lead to\nmodel collapse [ 29], leading to models gradually degenerating as a result. Similar arguments\nhave been made against using synthetic data for pos-training, which could amount to an\nimitation process that could teach the trained model to pick only stylistic characteristics\nand not real capabilities [ 8]. This discrepancy could be explained by the observation that\ncreating high-quality and diverse synthetic data is hard [ 17]. Successful use of synthetic data\ninvolved significant human effort in curating and filtering the data to ensure high quality. If\nwe focus on post-training synthetic data, we will see the most widely used approach includes\nstarting with a set of prompts and using a powerful model such as GPT-4 [ 22] to generate\nresponses to these prompts [ 24] or of an expanded set of the prompts [ 36]. This recipe\nwas further improved by eliciting explanations or step-by-step instructions from the teacher\nmodel [20] or using more complex prompting techniques to elicit higher quality answers [ 18].\nSynthetic data meets Agents : Another major development we witnessed last year is the\nrise of Agentic (especially multiagent) workflows [ 33,13]. Agentic workflows can generate\nhigh quality data, that surpasses the capabilities of the underlying LLMs, by using flows\nwith reflection and iteration, where agents can look back at solutions, generate critiques and\nimprove solutions. They can also use tools (e.g. search apis, calculator, code interpreters)\naddressing limitations of LLMs. Multi-agent workflows bring in additional benefits such\nas simulating scenarios where we can generate both new prompts and the corresponding\nresponses. They also enable automation of the data generation workflows reducing or\neliminating need for human intervention on some tasks.\nGenerative Teaching & Orca AgentInstruct : Generating synthetic data for post-\ntraining often relies on an existing prompt set that is used as is or used as seeds for\ngenerating more instructions. In this work, we generalize the problem settings to a broader\nobjective of generating abundant amounts of diverse, challenging and high-quality data to\nte\nOutput:"}}
