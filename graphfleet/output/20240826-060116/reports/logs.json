Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n•Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covari AG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears , query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and\nnot just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al.,  of every hallucinated text part from the summary in\nlist format; if no, leave this empty.\"}\nUse the format:\nAnalysis:\nsection 1:\nwrite the part of the summary\nrelevant segments:\nextract relevant segments from the article\njudgement:\ndecide if the section of the summary is supported by the article\nrepeat this for all sections\n....\nFinal verdict:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part in list format; if no,\nleave this empty.\"}\nFigure 5: Prompt template used for hallucination detection in Text Summarization.\nB.1 Summarization Quality and Hallucination Evaluation\nWe use GPT-4 with the following prompts for evaluating quality and hallucination in\nsummarization:\n31Quality Judge Example\nPlease act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the\nresponse provided by an AI assistant to the user instruction\ndisplayed lm: Empowering large language models to follow complex instructions,\n2023.\n[37]Longhui Yu, Weisen Jiang, Han Shi, Jincheng Yu, Zhengying Liu, Yu Zhang, James T Kwok,\nZhenguo Li, Adrian Weller, and Weiyang Liu.

In terms of open-source software, a variety a graph databases are\nsupported by both the LangChain (LangChain, 2024) and LlamaIndex (Llama  entire corpus is then made possible using\na map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently\nand in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.\nTo evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-\nmaking questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-\ncast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-\nsity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and\nthemes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries\nused to answer queries, as well as compare to na ¨ıve RAG and global map-reduce summarization\nof source texts.

It first retrieves relevant documents and then uses these documents to generate a response.\nTool Use Tool use involves the manipulation of tools to achieve goals. In AI, this refers to the\nability of an AI system to use available resources or auxiliary systems to solve complex tasks.\nCreative Content Generation Creative content generation involves the creation of original\ncontent, often involving elements of novelty, value, and surprise.

Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n•Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covari AG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears , query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and\nnot just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al.,  of every hallucinated text part from the summary in\nlist format; if no, leave this empty.\"}\nUse the format:\nAnalysis:\nsection 1:\nwrite the part of the summary\nrelevant segments:\nextract relevant segments from the article\njudgement:\ndecide if the section of the summary is supported by the article\nrepeat this for all sections\n....\nFinal verdict:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part in list format; if no,\nleave this empty.\"}\nFigure 5: Prompt template used for hallucination detection in Text Summarization.\nB.1 Summarization Quality and Hallucination Evaluation\nWe use GPT-4 with the following prompts for evaluating quality and hallucination in\nsummarization:\n31Quality Judge Example\nPlease act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the\nresponse provided by an AI assistant to the user instruction\ndisplayed lm: Empowering large language models to follow complex instructions,\n2023.\n[37]Longhui Yu, Weisen Jiang, Han Shi, Jincheng Yu, Zhengying Liu, Yu Zhang, James T Kwok,\nZhenguo Li, Adrian Weller, and Weiyang Liu.

Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n•Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covari AG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears , query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and\nnot just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al.,  of every hallucinated text part from the summary in\nlist format; if no, leave this empty.\"}\nUse the format:\nAnalysis:\nsection 1:\nwrite the part of the summary\nrelevant segments:\nextract relevant segments from the article\njudgement:\ndecide if the section of the summary is supported by the article\nrepeat this for all sections\n....\nFinal verdict:\n{\"hallucination_detected\": \"yes/no\", \"hallucinated_span\": \"If yes,\nthe exact span of every hallucinated text part in list format; if no,\nleave this empty.\"}\nFigure 5: Prompt template used for hallucination detection in Text Summarization.\nB.1 Summarization Quality and Hallucination Evaluation\nWe use GPT-4 with the following prompts for evaluating quality and hallucination in\nsummarization:\n31Quality Judge Example\nPlease act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the\nresponse provided by an AI assistant to the user instruction\ndisplayed lm: Empowering large language models to follow complex instructions,\n2023.\n[37]Longhui Yu, Weisen Jiang, Han Shi, Jincheng Yu, Zhengying Liu, Yu Zhang, James T Kwok,\nZhenguo Li, Adrian Weller, and Weiyang Liu.

In terms of open-source software, a variety a graph databases are\nsupported by both the LangChain (LangChain, 2024) and LlamaIndex (Llama  entire corpus is then made possible using\na map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently\nand in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.\nTo evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-\nmaking questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-\ncast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-\nsity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and\nthemes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries\nused to answer queries, as well as compare to na ¨ıve RAG and global map-reduce summarization\nof source texts.

It first retrieves relevant documents and then uses these documents to generate a response.\nTool Use Tool use involves the manipulation of tools to achieve goals. In AI, this refers to the\nability of an AI system to use available resources or auxiliary systems to solve complex tasks.\nCreative Content Generation Creative content generation involves the creation of original\ncontent, often involving elements of novelty, value, and surprise.
