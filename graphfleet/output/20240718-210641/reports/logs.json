This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess\nwhether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM\nresponds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that \u201cMANY entities were missed\nin the last extraction\u201d encourages the LLM to glean these missing entities.

We also support\na secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the\nextracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt aims to extract claims linked to detected\nentities, including the subject, object, type, description, source text span, and start and end dates.\nTo balance the needs of efficiency and quality, we use multiple rounds of \u201cgleanings\u201d, up to a\nspecified maximum, to encourage the LLM to detect any additional entities it may have missed\non prior extraction rounds. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess\nwhether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM\nresponds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that \u201cMANY entities were missed\nin the last extraction\u201d encourages the LLM to glean these missing entities. This approach allows us\nto use larger chunk sizes without a drop in quality (Figure 2) or the forced introduction of noise.\n2.3 Element Instances \u2192Element Summaries\nThe use of an LLM"}}

Given such a graph, a variety of community\ndetection algorithms may be used to partition the graph into communities of nodes with stronger\nconnections to one another than to the other nodes in the graph (e.g., see the surveys by Fortu-\nnato, 2010 and Jin et al., 2021). In our pipeline, we use Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) on account of\nits ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently (Figure 3).\nEach level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a\nmutually-exclusive, collective-exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization.\n2.5 Graph Communities \u2192Community Summaries\nThe next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using\na method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in\ntheir own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may\nthemselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question.

We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects of the graph index (including\nthe generic community summaries and the use of other graph-related RAG approaches).\nFuture work . The graph index, rich text annotations, and hierarchical community structure support-\ning the current Graph RAG approach offer many possibilities for refinement and adaptation. This\nincludes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of\nuser queries and graph annotations, as well as the possibility of hybrid RAG schemes that combine\nembedding-based matching against community reports before employing our map-reduce summa-\nrization mechanisms.

We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects of the graph index (including\nthe generic community summaries and the use of other graph-related RAG approaches).\nFuture work . The graph index, rich text annotations, and hierarchical community structure support-\ning the current Graph RAG approach offer many possibilities for refinement and adaptation. This\nincludes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of\nuser queries and graph annotations, as well as the possibility of hybrid RAG schemes that combine\nembedding-based matching against community reports before employing our map-reduce summa-\nrization mechanisms. This \u201croll-up\u201d operation could also be extended across more levels of the\ncommunity hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory \u201cdrill down\u201d mechanism that\nfollows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to"}}

In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast\ndataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset.

This \u201croll-up\u201d operation could also be extended across more levels of the\ncommunity hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory \u201cdrill down\u201d mechanism that\nfollows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to support human\nsensemaking over entire text corpora. Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a\nna\u00a8\u0131ve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable\ncomparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For\nsituations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi-\nties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG and\nachieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is\nforthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\n11Acknowledgements\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso Guevara\nFern \u00b4andez, Amber Hoak, Andr \u00b4es Morales Esquivel, Ben Cutler, Bill\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a\nna\u00a8\u0131ve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable\ncomparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For\nsituations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi-\nties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG and\nachieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is\nforthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\n11Acknowledgements\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso Guevara\nFern \u00b4andez, Amber Hoak, Andr \u00b4es Morales Esquivel, Ben Cutler, Bill"}}
