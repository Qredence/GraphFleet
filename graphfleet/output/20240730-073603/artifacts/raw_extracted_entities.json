Prior\nQFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical\nRAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose\na Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales\nwith both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be in-\ndexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages:\nfirst to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pre-\ngenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a\nquestion, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before\nall partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a\nclass of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range,\nwe show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG\nbaseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An\nopen-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG\napproaches is forthcoming at https:\/\/aka .ms\/graphrag .\n1 Introduction\nHuman endeavors across a range of domains rely on our ability to read and reason about large\ncollections of documents, often reaching conclusions that go beyond anything stated in the source\ntexts themselves. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), we are already witnessing\nattempts to automate human-like sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Mi-\ncrosoft, 2023) and intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023), where sensemaking is defined as\nPreprint.

This\nindex spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims) that have\nbeen detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the dataset.\nCommunity detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index into\ngroups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both index-\ning time and query time.

Supporting\nhuman-led sensemaking over entire text corpora, however, needs a way for people to both apply and\nrefine their mental model of the data (Klein et al., 2006b) by asking questions of a global nature.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to answering\nuser questions over entire datasets, but it is designed for situations where these answers are contained\nlocally within regions of text whose retrieval provides sufficient grounding for the generation task.\nInstead, a more appropriate task framing is query-focused summarization

{"id":"55ec70780a07388aca4be80802ea19f1","chunk":"2006b) by asking questions of a global nature.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to answering\nuser questions over entire datasets, but it is designed for situations where these answers are contained\nlocally within regions of text whose retrieval provides sufficient grounding for the generation task.\nInstead, a more appropriate task framing is query-focused summarization (QFS, Dang, 2006), and in\nparticular, query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and\nnot just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al., 2023) series,\nall of which can use in-context learning to summarize any content provided in their context window.\nThe challenge remains, however, for query-focused abstractive summarization over an entire corpus.\nSuch volumes of text can greatly exceed the limits of LLM context windows, and the expansion of\nsuch windows may not be enough given that information can be \u201clost in the middle\u201d of longer\ncontexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In addition, although the direct retrieval of text\nchunks in na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG is likely inadequate for QFS tasks, it is possible that an alternative form of\npre-indexing could support a new RAG approach specifically targeting global summarization.\nIn this paper, we present a Graph RAG approach based on global summarization of an LLM-derived\nknowledge graph (Figure 1). In contrast with related work that exploits the structured retrieval\nand traversal affordances of graph indexes (subsection 4.2), we focus on a previously unexplored\nquality of graphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability of com-\nmunity detection algorithms to partition graphs into modular communities of closely-related nodes\n(e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al., 2008; Leiden, Traag et al., 2019). LLM-generated summaries of these\n20 1 2 30100002000030000\nNumber of gleanings performedEntity references detected600 chunk size\n1200 chunk size\n2400 chunk size\nFigure 2: How the entity references detected in the HotPotQA dataset (Yang et al., 2018)\nvaries with chunk size and gleanings for our generic entity extraction prompt with gpt-4-turbo .\ncommunity descriptions provide complete coverage of the underlying graph index and the input doc-\numents it represents. Query-focused summarization of an entire corpus is then made possible using\na map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently\nand in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.\nTo evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-\nmaking questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-\ncast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-\nsity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and\nthemes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries\nused to answer queries, as well as compare to na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG and global map-reduce summarization\nof source texts. We show that all global approaches outperform na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG on comprehensiveness\nand diversity, and that Graph RAG with intermediate- and low-level community summaries shows\nfavorable performance over source text summarization on these same metrics, at lower token costs.\n2 Graph RAG Approach & Pipeline\nWe now unpack the high-level data flow of the Graph RAG approach (Figure 1) and pipeline, de-\nscribing key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\n2.1 Source Documents \u2192Text Chunks\nA fundamental design decision is the granularity with

{"id":"1e97679db415c7c17b35542305f23ced","chunk":"\nfavorable performance over source text summarization on these same metrics, at lower token costs.\n2 Graph RAG Approach & Pipeline\nWe now unpack the high-level data flow of the Graph RAG approach (Figure 1) and pipeline, de-\nscribing key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\n2.1 Source Documents \u2192Text Chunks\nA fundamental design decision is the granularity with which input texts extracted from source doc-\numents should be split into text chunks for processing. In the following step, each of these chunks\nwill be passed to a set of LLM prompts designed to extract the various elements of a graph index.\nLonger text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction, but suffer from the recall degrada-\ntion of longer LLM context windows (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). This behavior can be\nobserved in Figure 2 in the case of a single extraction round (i.e., with zero gleanings): on a sample\ndataset (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), using a chunk size of 600 token extracted almost twice as\nmany entity references as when using a chunk size of 2400. While more references are generally\nbetter, any extraction process needs to balance recall and precision for the target activity.\n2.2 Text Chunks \u2192Element Instances\nThe baseline requirement for this step is to identify and extract instances of graph nodes and edges\nfrom each chunk of source text. We do this using a multipart LLM prompt that first identifies all\nentities in the text, including their name, type, and description, before identifying all relationships\nbetween clearly-related entities, including the source and target entities and a description of their\nrelationship. Both kinds of element instance are output in a single list of delimited tuples.\nThe primary opportunity to tailor this prompt to the domain of the document corpus lies in the\nchoice of few-shot examples provided to the LLM for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020).\n3For example, while our default prompt extracting the broad class of \u201cnamed entities\u201d like people,\nplaces, and organizations is generally applicable, domains with specialized knowledge (e.g., science,\nmedicine, law) will benefit from few-shot examples specialized to those domains. We also support\na secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the\nextracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt aims to extract claims linked to detected\nentities, including the subject, object, type, description, source text span, and start and end dates.\nTo balance the needs of efficiency and quality, we use multiple rounds of \u201cgleanings\u201d, up to a\nspecified maximum, to encourage the LLM to detect any additional entities it may have missed\non prior extraction rounds. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess\nwhether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes\/no decision. If the LLM\nresponds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that \u201cMANY entities were missed\nin the last extraction\u201d encourages the LLM to glean these missing entities. This approach allows us\nto use larger chunk sizes without a drop in quality (Figure 2) or the forced introduction of noise.\n2.3 Element Instances \u2192Element Summaries\nThe use of an LLM to \u201cextract\u201d descriptions of entities, relationships, and claims represented in\nsource texts is already a form of abstractive summarization, relying on the LLM to create inde-\npendently meaningful summaries of concepts that may be implied but not stated by the text itself\n(e.g., the presence of implied relationships). To convert all such instance-level summaries into sin-\ngle blocks of descriptive text for each graph element (i.e., entity node, relationship edge, and claim\ncovariate) requires a further round of LLM summarization over matching groups of instances.\nA potential concern at this stage is that the LLM may not consistently extract references to the\nsame entity in the same text format, resulting in duplicate entity elements and thus duplicate nodes\nin the entity graph. However, since all closely-related \u201ccommunities\u201d of entities will be detected\nand summarized in the following step, and given that LLMs can understand the common entity\nbehind multiple name variations, our overall approach is resilient to such variations provided there\nis sufficient connectivity from all variations to a shared set of closely-related entities.\nOverall, our use of rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure\nis aligned with both the capabilities of LLMs and the needs of global, query-focused summarization.\nThese qualities also differentiate our graph index from typical knowledge graphs, which rely on\nconcise and consistent knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object) for downstream reasoning tasks.\n2.4

{"id":"c5a27b7f9fad18a6ad22416c453ae383","chunk":" is resilient to such variations provided there\nis sufficient connectivity from all variations to a shared set of closely-related entities.\nOverall, our use of rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure\nis aligned with both the capabilities of LLMs and the needs of global, query-focused summarization.\nThese qualities also differentiate our graph index from typical knowledge graphs, which rely on\nconcise and consistent knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object) for downstream reasoning tasks.\n2.4 Element Summaries \u2192Graph Communities\nThe index created in the previous step can be modelled as an homogeneous undirected weighted\ngraph in which entity nodes are connected by relationship edges, with edge weights representing the\nnormalized counts of detected relationship instances. Given such a graph, a variety of community\ndetection algorithms may be used to partition the graph into communities of nodes with stronger\nconnections to one another than to the other nodes in the graph (e.g., see the surveys by Fortu-\nnato, 2010 and Jin et al., 2021). In our pipeline, we use Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) on account of\nits ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently (Figure 3).\nEach level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a\nmutually-exclusive, collective-exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization.\n2.5 Graph Communities \u2192Community Summaries\nThe next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using\na method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in\ntheir own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may\nthemselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question. For example, a user\nmay scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then\nfollow links to the reports at the lower level that provide more details for each of the subtopics. Here,\nhowever, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\nCommunity summaries are generated in the following way:\n4(a) Root communities at level 0 (b) Sub-communities at level 1\nFigure 3: Graph communities detected using the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) over the\nMultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024) dataset as indexed. Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n\u2022Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covariates, and the edge itself.\n\u2022Higher-level communities . If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the con-\ntext window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries\nwithin the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element\nsummary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their\nassociated element summaries (longer) until fit within the context window is achieved.\n2.6 Community Summaries \u2192Community Answers \u2192Global Answer\nGiven a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate\na final answer in a multi-stage process. The hierarchical nature of the community structure also\nmeans that questions can be answered using the community summaries from different levels, raising\nthe question of whether a particular level in the hierarchical community structure offers the best\nbalance of summary detail and scope for general sensemaking questions (evaluated in section 3).\nFor a given community level, the global answer to any user query is generated as follows:\n\u2022Prepare community summaries . Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided\ninto chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed\nacross chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost) in a single context window.\n\u2022Map community answers . Generate intermediate answers in parallel, one for each chunk.\nThe LLM is also asked to generate a score between 0-100 indicating how helpful the gen-\nerated answer is in answering the target question","chunk_id":"c5a27b7f9fad18a6ad22416c453ae383","document_ids":["0668cddc5f873265ba50da5a0a06edad"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"GRAPH

Generate intermediate answers in parallel, one for each chunk.\nThe LLM is also asked to generate a score between 0-100 indicating how helpful the gen-\nerated answer is in answering the target question.

How can educators use the dataset to highlight the importance of health literacy?\nTable 1: Examples of potential users, tasks, and questions generated by the LLM based on short\ndescriptions of the target datasets. Questions target global understanding rather than specific details.\n3 Evaluation\n3.1 Datasets\nWe selected two datasets in the one million token range, each equivalent to about 10 novels of text\nand representative of the kind of corpora that users may encounter in their real world activities:\n\u2022Podcast transcripts . Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,\nMicrosoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669\n\u00d7600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( \u223c1 million tokens).\n\u2022News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September\n2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,\ntechnology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 \u00d7\n600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( \u223c1.7 million tokens).\n3.2 Queries\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\nthe associated question sets target explicit fact retrieval rather than summarization for the purpose\nof data sensemaking, i.e., the process though which people inspect, engage with, and contextualize\ndata within the broader scope of real-world activities (Koesten et al., 2021). Similarly, methods for\nextracting latent summarization queries from source texts also exist (Xu and Lapata, 2021), but such\nextracted questions can target details that betray prior knowledge of the texts.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for more global sensemaking tasks, we need questions\nthat convey only a high-level understanding of dataset contents, and not the details of specific texts.\nWe used an activity-centered approach to automate the generation of such questions: given a short\ndescription of a dataset, we asked the LLM to identify Npotential users and Ntasks per user,\nthen for each (user, task) combination, we asked the LLM to generate Nquestions that require\nunderstanding of the entire corpus. For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n63.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C0,C1,C2,C3), a text summarization method applying our map-reduce approach\ndirectly to source texts ( TS), and a na \u00a8\u0131ve \u201csemantic search\u201d RAG approach ( SS):\n\u2022CO.

{"id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf","chunk":" dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n63.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C0,C1,C2,C3), a text summarization method applying our map-reduce approach\ndirectly to source texts ( TS), and a na \u00a8\u0131ve \u201csemantic search\u201d RAG approach ( SS):\n\u2022CO. Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.\n\u2022C1. Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities\nof C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected down.\n\u2022C2. Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-\ncommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected down.\n\u2022C3. Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These\nare sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected down.\n\u2022TS. The same method as in subsection 2.6, except source texts (rather than community\nsummaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.\n\u2022SS. An implementation of na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the\navailable context window until the specified token limit is reached.\nThe size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across\nall six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context\ninformation used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.\nThe graph index supporting conditions C0-C3was created using our generic prompts for entity and\nrelationship extraction only, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the\ndata. The graph indexing process used a context window size of 600 tokens with 1 gleaning for the\nPodcast dataset and 0 gleanings for the News dataset.\n3.4 Metrics\nLLMs have been shown to be good evaluators of natural language generation, achieving state-of-\nthe-art or competitive results compared against human judgements (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al.,\n2024). While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are\nknown, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in a reference-\nfree style (Wang et al., 2023a) as well as in head-to-head comparison of competing outputs (LLM-\nas-a-judge, Zheng et al., 2024). LLMs have also shown promise at evaluating the performance of\nconventional RAG systems, automatically evaluating qualities like context relevance, faithfulness,\nand answer relevance (RAGAS, Es et al., 2023).\nGiven the multi-stage nature of our Graph RAG mechanism, the multiple conditions we wanted to\ncompare, and the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we\ndecided to adopt a head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator. We selected three\ntarget metrics capturing qualities that are desirable for sensemaking activities, as well as a control\nmetric (directness) used as a indicator of validity. Since directness is effectively in opposition to\ncomprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four metrics.\nOur head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\n\u2022Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and\ndetails of the question?\n\u2022Diversity . How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights\non the question?\n\u2022Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed\njudgements about the topic?\n\u2022Directness . How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and\nasked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner\nif one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible.\nTo account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.\nTable 2 shows an example of LLM-generated assessment.\n7Question Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\nGraph\nRAGOverview of Prominent Public Figures in Entertainment\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and\ndigital media. Certain public figures stand out due to their significant contributions and influence\nacross these sectors. The following summary highlights key individuals who are repeatedly\nmentioned in various entertainment articles, reflecting their impact and presence within the industry.\nActors and","chunk_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf","document_ids":["0668cddc5f873265ba50da5a0a06edad"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"GRAPH RAG\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Graph RAG is a method used in the analysis, employing four levels of graph communities (C0, C1, C2, C3) to answer user queries.\"","source_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf"},{"name":"\"TEXT SUMMARIZATION (TS)\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Text Summarization (TS) is a method that applies a map-reduce approach directly to source texts for summarization.\"","source_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf"},{"name":"\"SEMANTIC SEARCH (SS)\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Semantic Search (SS) is a naive RAG approach where text chunks are retrieved and added to the context window until the token limit is reached.\"","source_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf"},{"name":"\"C0\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"C0 uses root-level community summaries, which are the fewest in number, to answer user queries.\"","source_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf"},{"name":"\"C1\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"C1 uses high-level community summaries, which are sub-communities of C0 or projected down from C0, to answer user queries.\"","source_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf"},{"name":"\"C2\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"C2 uses intermediate-level community summaries, which are sub-communities of C1 or projected down from C1, to answer user queries.\"","source_id":"993f1cfa34b5b04498b9edf3b5aaeddf"},{"name":"\"C3\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"C3 uses low-level community summaries, which are the greatest in number, to answer user queries.

Certain public figures stand out due to their significant contributions and influence\nacross these sectors. The following summary highlights key individuals who are repeatedly\nmentioned in various entertainment articles, reflecting their impact and presence within the industry.\nActors and Directors [...]Public Figures in Controversy [...]Musicians and Executives [...]\nAthletes and Coaches [...]Influencers and Entrepreneurs [...]\nThe repeated mention of these figures in entertainment articles signifies their ongoing relevance and\nthe public\u2019s interest in their work. Their influence spans across various aspects of entertainment, from\nshaping cultural narratives in film and television to driving trends in music and digital media. These\nindividuals not only contribute to their respective fields but also influence the broader cultural\nlandscape, often becoming central figures in social discussions and public discourse.\nNa\u00a8\u0131ve\nRAGPublic figures who are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles include Taylor\nSwift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. These individuals have been highlighted\nfor various reasons, ranging from their professional achievements to their personal lives.\nTaylor Swift [...]Travis Kelce [...]Britney Spears [...]Justin Timberlake [...]\nThese figures are frequently covered due to their high-profile status and the public\u2019s interest in their\ncareers and personal lives. Their activities, whether in music, sports, or personal relationships, have\nsignificant cultural and economic impacts, as evidenced by the media coverage and public reactions.\nLLM\nDecisionComprehensiveness: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of public figures from a\nwider range of entertainment sectors, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital\nmedia. It also includes specific examples of their contributions and the impact they have on their\nrespective fields, as well as mentions of controversies and their implications. Answer 2, while\ndetailed in its coverage of a few individuals, is limited to a smaller number of public figures and\nfocuses primarily on their personal lives and relationships rather than a broad spectrum of their\nprofessional influence across the entertainment industry.\nDiversity: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more varied and rich response by covering a wide range of\npublic figures from different sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music,\nsports, gaming, and digital media. It offers insights into the contributions and influence of these\nfigures, as well as controversies and their impact on public discourse. The answer also cites specific\ndata sources for each mentioned figure, indicating a diverse range of evidence to support the claims.\nIn contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures, primarily from the music industry\nand sports, and relies heavily on a single source for data, which makes it less diverse in perspectives\nand insights.\nEmpowerment: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a comprehensive and structured overview of public figures\nacross various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music, sports, and\ndigital media. It lists multiple individuals, providing specific examples of their contributions and the\ncontext in which they are mentioned in entertainment articles, along with references to data reports\nfor each claim. This approach helps the reader understand the breadth of the topic and make informed\njudgments without being misled. In contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures\nand primarily discusses their personal lives and relationships, which may not provide as broad an\nunderstanding of the topic. While Answer 2 also cites sources, it does not match the depth and variety\nof Answer 1.\nDirectness: Winner=2 (Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG)\nAnswer 2 is better because it directly lists specific public figures who are repeatedly mentioned\nacross various entertainment articles, such as Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin\nTimberlake, and provides concise explanations for their frequent mentions. Answer 1, while\ncomprehensive, includes a lot of detailed information about various figures in different sectors of\nentertainment, which, while informative, does not directly answer the question with the same level of\nconciseness and specificity as Answer 2.\nTable 2: Example question for the News article dataset, with generated answers from Graph RAG\n(C2) and Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG, as well

Conditions C1-C3 also showed slight improvements in answer\ncomprehensiveness and diversity over TS (global text summarization without a graph index).\n3.5 Configuration\nThe effect of context window size on any particular task is unclear, especially for models like\ngpt-4-turbo with a large context size of 128k tokens. Given the potential for information to\nbe \u201clost in the middle\u201d of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to ex-\nplore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and\nmetrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast\ndataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset.

Table 3 shows the\nnumber of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.\nGlobal approaches vs. na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG . As shown in Figure 4, global approaches consistently out-\nperformed the na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG ( SS) approach in both comprehensiveness and diversity metrics across\ndatasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 72-83%\nfor Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82%\nand 62-71% respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test also achieved the expected results,\ni.e., that na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG produces the most direct responses across all comparisons.\n9Podcast Transcripts News Articles\nC0 C1 C2 C3 TS C0 C1 C2 C3 TS\nUnits 34 367 969 1310 1669 55 555 1797 2142 3197\nTokens 26657 225756 565720 746100 1014611 39770 352641 980898 1140266 1707694\n% Max 2.6 22.2 55.8 73.5 100 2.3 20.7 57.4 66.8 100\nTable 3: Number of context units (community summaries for C0-C3 and text chunks for TS), corre-\nsponding token counts, and percentage of the maximum token count. Map-reduce summarization of\nsource texts is the most resource-intensive approach requiring the highest number of context tokens.\nRoot-level community summaries ( C0) require dramatically fewer tokens per query (9x-43x).\nCommunity summaries vs. source texts. When comparing community summaries to source texts\nusing Graph RAG, community summaries generally provided a small but consistent improvement\nin answer comprehensiveness and diversity, except for root-level summaries. Intermediate-level\nsummaries in the Podcast dataset and low-level community summaries in the News dataset achieved\ncomprehensiveness win rates of 57% and 64%, respectively. Diversity win rates were 57% for\nPodcast intermediate-level summaries and 60% for News low-level community summaries. Table 3\nalso illustrates the scalability advantages of Graph RAG compared to source text summarization: for\nlow-level community summaries ( C3), Graph RAG required 26-33% fewer context tokens, while\nfor root-level community summaries ( C0), it required over 97% fewer tokens. For a modest drop in\nperformance compared with other global methods, root-level Graph RAG offers a highly efficient\nmethod for the iterative question answering that characterizes sensemaking activity, while retaining\nadvantages in comprehensiveness (72% win rate) and diversity (62% win rate) over na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG.\nEmpowerment . Empowerment comparisons showed mixed results for both global approaches versus\nna\u00a8\u0131ve RAG ( SS) and Graph RAG approaches versus source text summarization ( TS). Ad-hoc LLM\nuse to analyze LLM reasoning for this measure indicated that the ability to provide specific exam-\nples, quotes, and citations was judged to be key to helping users reach an informed understanding.\nTuning element extraction prompts may help to retain more of these details in the Graph RAG index.\n4 Related Work\n4.1 RAG Approaches and Systems\nWhen using LLMs, RAG involves first retrieving relevant information from external data sources,\nthen adding this information to the context window of the LLM along with the original query (Ram\net al., 2023). Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG approaches (Gao et al., 2023) do this by converting documents to text,\nsplitting text into chunks, and embedding these chunks into a vector space in which similar positions\nrepresent similar semantics. Queries are then embedded into the same vector space, with the text\nchunks of the nearest kvectors used as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM\u2019s context window.\nAdvanced RAG systems include pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval strategies designed to over-\ncome the drawbacks of Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG, while Modular RAG systems include patterns for iterative and\ndynamic cycles of interleaved retrieval and generation (Gao et al., 2023).

{"id":"36b3475f15d02b229d4190b0b401085f","chunk":" as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM\u2019s context window.\nAdvanced RAG systems include pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval strategies designed to over-\ncome the drawbacks of Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG, while Modular RAG systems include patterns for iterative and\ndynamic cycles of interleaved retrieval and generation (Gao et al., 2023). Our implementation of\nGraph RAG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears resemblance to further\napproaches, such as generating a hierarchical index of text chunks by clustering the vectors of text\nembeddings (RAPTOR, Sarthi et al., 2024) or generating a \u201ctree of clarifications\u201d to answer mul-\ntiple interpretations of ambiguous questions (Kim et al., 2023). However, none of these iterative or\nhierarchical approaches use the kind of self-generated graph index that enables Graph RAG.\n104.2 Graphs and LLMs\nUse of graphs in connection with LLMs and RAG is a developing research area, with multiple\ndirections already established. These include using LLMs for knowledge graph creation (Tra-\njanoska et al., 2023) and completion (Yao et al., 2023), as well as for the extraction of causal\ngraphs (Ban et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) from source texts. They also include forms of ad-\nvanced RAG (Gao et al., 2023) where the index is a knowledge graph (KAPING, Baek et al., 2023),\nwhere subsets of the graph structure (G-Retriever, He et al., 2024) or derived graph metrics (Graph-\nToolFormer, Zhang, 2023) are the objects of enquiry, where narrative outputs are strongly grounded\nin the facts of retrieved subgraphs (SURGE, Kang et al., 2023), where retrieved event-plot sub-\ngraphs are serialized using narrative templates (FABULA, Ranade and Joshi, 2023), and where the\nsystem supports both creation and traversal of text-relationship graphs for multi-hop question an-\nswering (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of open-source software, a variety a graph databases are\nsupported by both the LangChain (LangChain, 2024) and LlamaIndex (LlamaIndex, 2024) libraries,\nwhile a more general class of graph-based RAG applications is also emerging, including systems that\ncan create and reason over knowledge graphs in both Neo4J (NaLLM, Neo4J, 2024) and Nebula-\nGraph (GraphRAG, NebulaGraph, 2024) formats. Unlike our Graph RAG approach, however, none\nof these systems use the natural modularity of graphs to partition data for global summarization.\n5 Discussion\nLimitations of evaluation approach . Our evaluation to date has only examined a certain class of\nsensemaking questions for two corpora in the region of 1 million tokens. More work is needed\nto understand how performance varies across different ranges of question types, data types, and\ndataset sizes, as well as to validate our sensemaking questions and target metrics with end users.\nComparison of fabrication rates, e.g., using approaches like SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023),\nwould also improve on the current analysis.\nTrade-offs of building a graph index . We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects","chunk_id":"36b3475f15d02b229d4190b0b401085f","document_ids":["0668cddc5f873265ba50da5a0a06edad"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"GRAPH

{"id":"950afbe992b1be1eb5d912ed068af2a2","chunk":"., 2023),\nwould also improve on the current analysis.\nTrade-offs of building a graph index . We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects of the graph index (including\nthe generic community summaries and the use of other graph-related RAG approaches).\nFuture work . The graph index, rich text annotations, and hierarchical community structure support-\ning the current Graph RAG approach offer many possibilities for refinement and adaptation. This\nincludes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of\nuser queries and graph annotations, as well as the possibility of hybrid RAG schemes that combine\nembedding-based matching against community reports before employing our map-reduce summa-\nrization mechanisms. This \u201croll-up\u201d operation could also be extended across more levels of the\ncommunity hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory \u201cdrill down\u201d mechanism that\nfollows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to support human\nsensemaking over entire text corpora. Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a\nna\u00a8\u0131ve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable\ncomparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For\nsituations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi-\nties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG and\nachieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is\nforthcoming at https:\/\/aka .ms\/graphrag .\n11Acknowledgements\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso Guevara\nFern \u00b4andez, Amber Hoak, Andr \u00b4es Morales Esquivel, Ben Cutler, Billie Rinaldi, Chris Sanchez,\nChris Trevino, Christine Caggiano, David Tittsworth, Dayenne de Souza, Douglas Orbaker, Ed\nClark, Gabriel Nieves-Ponce, Gaudy Blanco Meneses, Kate Lytvynets, Katy Smith, M \u00b4onica Carva-\njal, Nathan Evans, Richard Ortega, Rodrigo Racanicci, Sarah Smith, and Shane Solomon.\nReferences\nAchiam, J., Adler, S., Agarwal, S., Ahmad, L., Akkaya, I., Aleman, F.

Developers and end users interact with these systems through the use of\nprompting or prompt engineering. While prompting is a widespread and highly researched concept, there\nexists conflicting terminology and a poor ontological understanding of what constitutes a prompt due to the\narea\u2019s nascency. This paper establishes a structured understanding of prompts, by assembling a taxonomy\nof prompting techniques and analyzing their use. We present a comprehensive vocabulary of 33 vocabulary\nterms, a taxonomy of 58 text-only prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. We further\npresent a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting.\n1arXiv:2406.06608v2  [cs.CL]  17 Jun 2024Contents\n1 Introduction 4\n1.1 What is a Prompt? . . . . . . . . . 5\n1.2 Terminology . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n1.2.1 Components of a Prompt . 5\n1.2.2 Prompting Terms . . . . . 6\n1.3 A Short History of Prompts . . . . 7\n2 A Meta-Analysis of Prompting 8\n2.1 Systematic Review Process . . . . 8\n2.1.1 The Pipeline . . . . . . . 8\n2.2 Text-Based Techniques . . . . . . 8\n2.2.1 In-Context Learning (ICL) 8\n2.2.2 Zero-Shot . . . . . . . . . 11\n2.2.3 Thought Generation . . . 12\n2.2.4 Decomposition . . . . . . 13\n2.2.5 Ensembling . . . . . . . . 14\n2.2.6 Self-Criticism . . . . . . . 15\n2.3 Prompting Technique Usage . . . 15\n2.3.1 Benchmarks . . . . . . . . 17\n2.4 Prompt Engineering . . . . . . . . 17\n2.5 Answer Engineering . . . . . . . 17\n2.5.1 Answer Shape . . . . . . 18\n2.5.2 Answer Space . . . . . . . 18\n2.5.3 Answer Extractor . . . . . 18\n3 Beyond English Text Prompting 19\n3.1 Multilingual . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.1 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) . 19\n3.1.2 In-Context Learning . . . 19\n3.1.3 In-Context Example Selec-\ntion . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.4 Prompt Template Lan-\nguage Selection . . . . . . 19\n3.1.5 Prompting for Machine\nTranslation . . . . . . . . 20\n3.2 Multimodal . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n3.2.1 Image Prompting . . . . . 21\n3.2.2 Audio Prompting . . . . . 22\n3.2.","chunk_id":"d1af61f77ad6f49034ffa4e834a77faf","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GENAI)\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"GenAI systems are increasingly deployed across industry and research settings, involving the use of prompting or prompt engineering to interact with these systems.\"","source_id":"d1af61f77ad6f49034ffa4e834a77faf"},{"name":"\"PROMPTING\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Prompting is a widespread and highly researched concept in GenAI, involving the use of prompts to interact with AI systems.

Typically, these models\nrely on the user providing an input \u201cprompt\u201d to\nwhich the model produces an output in response.\nSuch prompts may be textual\u2014\u201cWrite a poem\nabout trees.\u201d\u2014or take other forms: images, audio,\nvideos, or a combination thereof. The ability to\nprompt models, particularly prompting with natu-\nral language, makes them easy to interact with and\nuse flexibly across a wide range of use cases.\nKnowing how to effectively structure, evaluate,\nand perform other tasks with prompts is essential\nto using these models. Empirically, better prompts\nlead to improved results across a wide range of\ntasks (Wei et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023b; Schul-\nhoff, 2022). A large body of literature has grown\naround the use of prompting to improve results\nand the number of prompting techniques is rapidly\nincreasing.\nHowever, as prompting is an emerging field, the\nuse of prompts continues to be poorly understood,\nwith only a fraction of existing terminologies and\ntechniques being well-known among practitioners.\nWe perform a large-scale review of prompting tech-\nniques to create a robust resource of terminology\nand techniques in the field. We expect this to be\nthe first iteration of terminologies that will develop\nover time.\nScope of Study We create a broad directory of\nprompting techniques, which can be quickly un-\nderstood and easily implemented for rapid experi-\nmentation by developers and researchers. To this\nend, we limit our study to focus on discrete pre-\nfix prompts (Shin et al., 2020a) rather than cloze\nprompts (Petroni et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2021),\nbecause modern LLM architectures (especially\ndecoder-only models), which use prefix prompts,\nare widely used and have robust support for both\nconsumers and researchers. Additionally, we re-\nfined our focus to hard (discrete) prompts rather\nthan soft (continuous) prompts and leave out papers\nthat make use of techniques using gradient-based\nupdates (i.e. fine-tuning). Finally, we only study\ntask-agnostic techniques.

{"id":"42fa2868f275e1b0f2269e560e9a5816","chunk":" and\nmaintain a manageable scope.\nSections Overview We conducted a machine-\nassisted systematic review grounded in the\nPRISMA process (Page et al., 2021) (Section 2.1)\nto identify 58 different text-based prompting tech-\nniques, from which we create a taxonomy with a\nrobust terminology of prompting terms (Section\n1.2).\nWhile much literature on prompting focuses on\nEnglish-only settings, we also discuss multilingual\ntechniques (Section 3.1). Given the rapid growth in\nmultimodal prompting, where prompts may include\nmedia such as images, we also expand our scope\nto multimodal techniques (Section 3.2). Many mul-\ntilingual and multimodal prompting techniques are\ndirect extensions of English text-only prompting\ntechniques.\nAs prompting techniques grow more complex,\nthey have begun to incorporate external tools, such\nas Internet browsing and calculators. We use the\nterm \u2018agents\u2018 to describe these types of prompting\ntechniques (Section 4.1).\nIt is important to understand how to evaluate\nthe outputs of agents and prompting techniques to\nensure accuracy and avoid hallucinations. Thus,\nwe discuss ways of evaluating these outputs (Sec-\n4tion 4.2). We also discuss security (Section 5.1)\nand safety measures (Section 5.2) for designing\nprompts that reduce the risk of harm to companies\nand users.\nFinally, we apply prompting techniques in two\ncase studies (Section 6.1). In the first, we test a\nrange of prompting techniques against the com-\nmonly used benchmark MMLU (Hendrycks et al.,\n2021). In the second, we explore in detail an exam-\nple of manual prompt engineering on a significant,\nreal-world use case, identifying signals of frantic\nhopelessness\u2013a top indicator of suicidal crisis\u2013in\nthe text of individuals seeking support (Schuck\net al., 2019a). We conclude with a discussion of\nthe nature of prompting and its recent development\n(Section 8).\n1.1 What is a Prompt?\nA prompt is an input to a Generative AI model, that\nis used to guide its output (Mesk\u00f3, 2023; White\net al., 2023; Heston and Khun, 2023; Hadi et al.,\n2023; Brown et al., 2020). Prompts may consist of\ntext, image, sound, or other media. Some examples\nof prompts include: \u201cwrite a three paragraph email\nfor a marketing campaign for an accounting firm\u201d,\na photograph of a table accompanied by the text\n\u201cdescribe everything on the table\u201d, or a recording\nof an online meeting, with the instructions \u201csum-\nmarize this\u201d.\nPrompt Template Prompts are often constructed\nvia a prompt template (Shin et al., 2020b). A\nprompt template is a function that contains one or\nmore variables which will be replaced by some me-\ndia (usually text) to create a prompt. This prompt\ncan then be considered to be an instance of the\ntemplate.\nConsider applying prompting to the task of bi-\nnary classification of tweets. Here is an initial\nprompt template that can be used to classify inputs.\nClassify the tweet as positive or negative:\n{TWEET}\nEach tweet in the dataset would be inserted into\na separate instance of the template and the resulting\nprompt would be given to a LLM for inference.Write a poem about trees.\nWrite a poem about the following topic:\n{USER_INPUT}\nFigure 1.2: Prompts and prompt templates are distinct\nconcepts; a prompt template becomes a prompt when\ninput is inserted into it.\n1.2 Terminology\n1.2.1 Components of a Prompt\nThere are a variety of common components in-\ncluded in a prompt. We summarize the most com-\nmonly used components and discuss how they fit\ninto prompts.\nDirective Many prompts issue a directive in the\nform of an instruction or question.1This is the\ncore intent of the prompt, sometimes simply called\nthe \"intent\". For example, here is an example of a\nprompt with a single instruction:\nTell me five good books to read.\nDirectives can also be implicit, as in this one-\nshot case, where the directive is to perform English\nto Spanish translation:\nNight: Noche\nMorning:\nExamples Examples, also known as exemplars or\nshots, act as demonstrations that guide the GenAI\nto accomplish a task. The above prompt is a One-\nShot (i.e. one example) prompt.\nOutput Formatting It is often desirable for the\nGenAI to output information in certain formats, for\nexample, CSVs or markdown formats (Xia et al.,\n2024).

For example, the action of sending a\nchunk of text or uploading an image constitutes\nprompting.\nPrompt Chain A prompt chain (activity: prompt\nchaining) consists of two or more prompt templates\nused in succession. The output of the prompt gen-\nerated by the first prompt template is used to pa-\nrameterize the second template, continuing until all\ntemplates are exhausted (Wu et al., 2022).\n3By robust, we mean that it covers most existing commonly\nused terms in the field.\n6x\u2081x\u2082x\u2099Pr ompt T emplat eGener ativ e AIExtr act orUtility F unctionDataset Inf er ence (i.e.  entries x\u2081 ...  x\u2099)\nModify Pr ompt \nT emplat e until \nDesider ata MetFigure 1.4: The Prompt Engineering Process consists of\nthree repeated steps 1) performing inference on a dataset\n2) evaluating performance and 3) modifying the prompt\ntemplate. Note that the extractor is used to extract a\nfinal response from the LLM output (e.g. \"This phrase\nis positive\"\u2192\"positive\"). See more information on\nextractors in Section 2.5.\nPrompting Technique A prompting technique\nis a blueprint that describes how to structure a\nprompt, prompts, or dynamic sequencing of multi-\nple prompts. A prompting technique may incorpo-\nrate conditional or branching logic, parallelism, or\nother architectural considerations spanning multi-\nple prompts.\nPrompt Engineering Prompt engineering is the\niterative process of developing a prompt by modify-\ning or changing the prompting technique that you\nare using (Figure 1.4).\nPrompt Engineering Technique A prompt engi-\nneering technique is a strategy for iterating on a\nprompt to improve it. In literature, this will often\nbe automated techniques (Deng et al., 2022), but\nin consumer settings, users often perform prompt\nengineering manually.\nExemplar Exemplars are examples of a task be-\ning completed that are shown to a model in a\nprompt (Brown et al., 2020).\n1.3 A Short History of Prompts\nThe idea of using natural language prefixes, or\nprompts, to elicit language model behaviors andresponses originated before the GPT-3 and Chat-\nGPT era. GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019a) makes\nuse of prompts and they appear to be first used in\nthe context of Generative AI by Fan et al. (2018).\nHowever, the concept of prompts was preceded by\nrelated concepts such as control codes (Pfaff, 1979;\nPoplack, 1980; Keskar et al., 2019) and writing\nprompts.\nThe term Prompt Engineering appears to have\ncome into existence more recently from Radford\net al. (2021) then slightly later from Reynolds and\nMcDonell (2021).\nHowever, various papers perform prompt engi-\nneering without naming the term (Wallace et al.,\n2019; Shin et al., 2020a), including Schick and\nSch\u00fctze (2020a,b); Gao et al. (2021) for non-\nautoregressive language models.\nSome of the first works on prompting define a\nprompt slightly differently to how it is currently\nused. For example, consider the following prompt\nfrom Brown et al. (2020):\nTranslate English to French:\nllama\nBrown et al. (2020) consider the word \"llama\" to\nbe the prompt, while \"Translate English to French:\"\nis the \"task description\". More recent papers, in-\ncluding this one, refer to the entire string passed to\nthe LLM as the prompt.\n72 A Meta-Analysis of Prompting\n2.1 Systematic Review Process\nIn order to robustly collect a dataset of sources\nfor this paper, we ran a systematic literature re-\nview grounded in the PRISMA process (Page et al.,\n2021) (Figure 2.1). We host this dataset on Hug-\ngingFace and present a datasheet (Gebru et al.,\n2021) for the dataset in Appendix A.3. Our main\ndata sources were arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and\nACL. We query these databases with a list of\n44 keywords narrowly related to prompting and\nprompt engineering (Appendix A.4).\n2.1.1 The Pipeline\nIn this section, we introduce our data scraping\npipeline, which includes both human and LLM-\nassisted review.4As an initial sample to estab-\nlish filtering critera","chunk_id":"7798b3210a865e03a3298ca49ad77cc4","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"PROMPTING\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Prompting is the process of providing a prompt to a Generative AI, which then generates a response.

Then, human annotators label a sample\nof 1,661 articles from the arXiv set for the follow-\ning criteria:\n1.Does the paper propose a novel prompting\ntechnique? (include)\n2.Does the paper strictly cover hard prefix\nprompts? (include)\n3.Does the paper focus on training by backprop-\nagating gradients? (exclude)\n4.For non-text modalities, does it use a masked\nframe and\/or window?

Next, we develop a\nprompt using GPT-4-1106-preview to classify the\nremaining articles. We validate the prompt against\n100 ground-truth annotations, achieving 89% pre-\ncision and 75% recall (for an F1of 81%). The\ncombined human and LLM annotations generate a\nfinal set of 1,565 papers.\n2.2 Text-Based Techniques\nWe now present a comprehensive taxonomical on-\ntology of 58 text-based prompting techniques, bro-\nken into 6 major categories (Figure 2.2).

However, in some cases, the bene-\nfits may diminish beyond 20 exemplars (Liu et al.,\n2021).Translate the word \"cheese\" to French.\nFigure 2.6: ICL from training data prompt.

For\nexample, if 10 exemplars from one class and 2\nexemplars of another class are included, this may\ncause the model to be biased toward the first class.\nExemplar Label Quality Despite the general ben-\nefit of multiple exemplars, the necessity of strictly\nvalid demonstrations is unclear. Some work (Min\net al., 2022) suggests that the accuracy of labels is\nirrelevant\u2014providing models with exemplars with\nincorrect labels may not negatively diminish per-\nformance. However, under certain settings, there\nis a significant impact on performance (Yoo et al.,\n2022). Larger models are often better at handling\nincorrect or unrelated labels (Wei et al., 2023c).\nIt is important to discuss this factor, since if you\nare automatically constructing prompts from large\ndatasets that may contain inaccuracies, it may be\nnecessary to study how label quality affects your\nresults.\nExemplar Format The formatting of exemplars\nalso affects performance. One of the most common\nformats is \u201cQ: {input}, A: {label}\u201d, but the optimal\nformat may vary across tasks; it may be worth\ntrying multiple formats to see which performs best.\n10There is some evidence to suggest that formats that\noccur commonly in the training data will lead to\nbetter performance (Jiang et al., 2020).\nExemplar Similarity Selecting exemplars that\nare similar to the test sample is generally bene-\nficial for performance (Liu et al., 2021; Min et al.,\n2022). However, in some cases, selecting more\ndiverse exemplars can improve performance (Su\net al., 2022; Min et al., 2022).\n2.2.1.2 Few-Shot Prompting Techniques\nConsidering all of these factors, Few-Shot Prompt-\ning can be very difficult to implement effectively.\nWe now examine techniques for Few-Shot Prompt-\ning in the supervised setting. Ensembling ap-\nproaches can also benefit Few-Shot Prompting, but\nwe discuss them separately (Section 2.2.5).\nAssume we have a training dataset, Dtrain,\nwhich contains multiple inputs Dtrain\nxiand outputs\nDtrain\nyi, which can be used to few-shot prompt a\nGenAI (rather than performing gradient-based up-\ndates). Assume that this prompt can be dynamically\ngenerated with respect to Dtest\nxiat test time. Here\nis the prompt template we will use for this section,\nfollowing the \u2018input: output\u2018 format (Figure 2.4):\n{Exemplars}\nDtest\nxi:\nFigure 2.7: Few-Shot Prompting Template\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) (Liu et al., 2021) is\npart of a family of algorithms that selects exemplars\nsimilar toDtest\nxito boost performance. Although ef-\nfective, employing KNN during prompt generation\nmay be time and resource intensive.\nVote-K (Su et al., 2022) is another method to\nselect similar exemplars to the test sample. In one\nstage, a model proposes useful unlabeled candidate\nexemplars for an annotator to label. In the sec-\nond stage, the labeled pool is used for Few-Shot\nPrompting. V ote-K also ensures that newly added\nexemplars are sufficiently different than existing\nones to increase diversity and representativeness.\nSelf-Generated In-Context Learning (SG-ICL)\n(Kim et al., 2022) leverages a GenAI to automati-\ncally generate exemplars. While better than zero-\nshot scenarios when training data is unavailable,the generated samples are not as effective as actual\ndata.\nPrompt Mining (Jiang et al., 2020) is the process\nof discovering optimal \"middle words\" in prompts\n(effectively prompt templates) through large corpus\nanalysis. For example, instead of using the com-\nmon \"Q: A:\" format for few-shot prompts, there\nmay exist something similar which occurs more fre-\nquently in the corpus. Formats which occur more\noften in the corpus will likely lead to improved\nprompt performance.\nMore Complicated Techniques such as LENS\n(Li and Qiu, 2023a), UDR (Li et al., 2023f), and\nActive","chunk_id":"e845d3c15484b3061e3a376fa8779883","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"EXEMPLAR LABEL

For example, instead of using the com-\nmon \"Q: A:\" format for few-shot prompts, there\nmay exist something similar which occurs more fre-\nquently in the corpus. Formats which occur more\noften in the corpus will likely lead to improved\nprompt performance.\nMore Complicated Techniques such as LENS\n(Li and Qiu, 2023a), UDR (Li et al., 2023f), and\nActive Example Selection (Zhang et al., 2022a)\nleverage iterative filtering, embedding and retrieval,\nand reinforcement learning, respectively.\n2.2.2 Zero-Shot\nIn contrast to Few-Shot Prompting, Zero-Shot\nPrompting uses zero exemplars. There are a num-\nber of well known standalone zero-shot techniques\nas well as zero-shot techniques combine with an-\nother concept (e.g. Chain of Thought), which we\ndiscuss later (Section 2.2.3).\nRole Prompting (Wang et al., 2023j; Zheng\net al., 2023d) , also known as persona prompting\n(Schmidt et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023l), assigns a\nspecific role to the GenAI in the prompt. For exam-\nple, the user might prompt it to act like \"Madonna\"\nor a \"travel writer\". This can create more desirable\noutputs for open-ended tasks (Reynolds and Mc-\nDonell, 2021) and in some cases improve accuracy\non benchmarks (Zheng et al., 2023d).\nStyle Prompting (Lu et al., 2023a) involves spec-\nifying the desired style, tone, or genre in the prompt\nto shape the output of a GenAI. A similar effect\ncan be achieved using role prompting.\nEmotion Prompting (Li et al., 2023a) incorpo-\nrates phrases of psychological relevance to humans\n(e.g., \"This is important to my career\") into the\nprompt, which may lead to improved LLM perfor-\nmance on benchmarks and open-ended text genera-\ntion.\nSystem 2 Attention (S2A) (Weston and\nSukhbaatar, 2023) first asks an LLM to rewrite\nthe prompt and remove any information unrelated\nto the question therein. Then, it passes this new\nprompt into an LLM to retrieve a final response.\n11SimToM (Wilf et al., 2023) deals with compli-\ncated questions which involve multiple people or\nobjects. Given the question, it attempts to establish\nthe set of facts one person knows, then answer the\nquestion based only on those facts. This is a two\nprompt process and can help eliminate the effect of\nirrelevant information in the prompt.\nRephrase and Respond (RaR) (Deng et al., 2023)\ninstructs the LLM to rephrase and expand the ques-\ntion before generating the final answer. For ex-\nample, it might add the following phrase to the\nquestion: \"Rephrase and expand the question, and\nrespond\". This could all be done in a single pass\nor the new question could be passed to the LLM\nseparately. RaR has demonstrated improvements\non multiple benchmarks.\nRe-reading (RE2) (Xu et al., 2023) adds the\nphrase \"Read the question again:\" to the prompt in\naddition to repeating the question. Although this is\nsuch a simple technique, it has shown improvement\nin reasoning benchmarks, especially with complex\nquestions.\nSelf-Ask (Press et al., 2022) prompts LLMs to\nfirst decide if they need to ask follow up questions\nfor a given prompt. If so, the LLM generates these\nquestions, then answers them and finally answers\nthe original question.\n2.2.3 Thought Generation\nThought generation encompasses a range of tech-\nniques that prompt the LLM to articulate its reason-\ning while solving a problem (Zhang et al., 2023c).\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (Wei et al.,\n2022) leverages few-shot prompting to encour-\nage the LLM to express its thought process before\ndelivering its final answer.5This technique is occa-\nsionally referred to as Chain-of-Thoughts (Tutunov\net al., 2023; Besta et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023d).\nIt has been demonstrated to significantly enhance\nthe LLM\u2019s performance in mathematics and reason-\ning tasks. In Wei et al. (2022), the prompt includes\nan exemplar featuring a question, a reasoning path,\nand the correct answer

{"id":"f4b740e8b0c84e29c7990fc370919464","chunk":"5This technique is occa-\nsionally referred to as Chain-of-Thoughts (Tutunov\net al., 2023; Besta et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023d).\nIt has been demonstrated to significantly enhance\nthe LLM\u2019s performance in mathematics and reason-\ning tasks. In Wei et al. (2022), the prompt includes\nan exemplar featuring a question, a reasoning path,\nand the correct answer (Figure 2.8).\n5We note that such techniques are often described using\nwords like \"think\" that anthropomorphize models. We attempt\nnot to use this language, but do use original authors\u2019 language\nwhere appropriate.Q: Jack has two baskets, each containing\nthree balls. How many balls does Jack have\nin total?\nA: One basket contains 3 balls, so two bas-\nkets contain 3 * 2 = 6 balls.\nQ: {QUESTION}\nA:\nFigure 2.8: A One-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompt.\n2.2.3.1 Zero-Shot-CoT\nThe most straightforward version of CoT contains\nzero exemplars. It involves appending a thought\ninducing phrase like \"Let\u2019s think step by step.\" (Ko-\njima et al., 2022) to the prompt. Other suggested\nthought-generating phrases include \"Let\u2019s work\nthis out in a step by step way to be sure we have the\nright answer\" (Zhou et al., 2022b) and \"First, let\u2019s\nthink about this logically\" (Kojima et al., 2022).\nYang et al. (2023a) searches for an optimal thought\ninducer. Zero-Shot-CoT approaches are attractive\nas they don\u2019t require exemplars and are generally\ntask agnostic.\nStep-Back Prompting (Zheng et al., 2023c) is a\nmodification of CoT where the LLM is first asked\na generic, high-level question about relevant con-\ncepts or facts before delving into reasoning. This\napproach has improved performance significantly\non multiple reasoning benchmarks for both PaLM-\n2L and GPT-4.\nAnalogical Prompting (Yasunaga et al., 2023)\nis similar to SG-ICL, and automatically generates\nexemplars that include CoTs. It has demonstrated\nimprovements in mathematical reasoning and code\ngeneration tasks.\nThread-of-Thought (ThoT) Prompting (Zhou\net al., 2023) consists of an improved thought in-\nducer for CoT reasoning. Instead of \"Let\u2019s think\nstep by step,\" it uses \"Walk me through this context\nin manageable parts step by step, summarizing and\nanalyzing as we go.\" This thought inducer works\nwell in question-answering and retrieval settings,\nespecially when dealing with large, complex con-\ntexts.\nTabular Chain-of-Thought (Tab-CoT) (Jin and\nLu, 2023) consists of a Zero-Shot CoT prompt that\nmakes the LLM output reasoning as a markdown\n12table. This tabular design enables the LLM to im-\nprove the structure and thus the reasoning of its\noutput.\n2.2.3.2 Few-Shot CoT\nThis set of techniques present the LLM with mul-\ntiple exemplars, which include chains-of-thought.\nThis can significantly enhance performance. This\ntechnique is occasionally referred to as Manual-\nCoT (Zhang et al., 2022b) or Golden CoT (Del and\nFishel, 2023).\nContrastive CoT Prompting (Chia et al., 2023)\nadds both exemplars with incorrect and correct ex-\nplanations to the CoT prompt in order to show the\nLLM how notto reason. This method has shown\nsignificant improvement in areas like Arithmetic\nReasoning and Factual QA.\nUncertainty-Routed CoT Prompting (Google,\n2023) samples multiple CoT reasoning paths, then\nselects the majority if it is above a certain thresh-\nold (calculated based on validation data). If not, it\nsamples greedily and selects that response. This\nmethod demonstrates improvement on the MMLU\nbenchmark for both GPT4 and Gemini Ultra mod-\nels.\nComplexity-based Prompting (Fu et al., 2023b)\ninvolves two major modifications to CoT. First, it\nselects complex examples for annotation and in-\nclusion in the prompt, based on factors like ques-\ntion length or reasoning steps required. Second,\nduring inference, it samples multiple reasoning\nchains (answers) and uses a majority vote among\nchains exceeding a certain length threshold, under\nthe premise","chunk_id":"f4b740e8b0c84e29c7990fc370919464","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Chain-of-Thoughts

{"id":"589a9782efd8ac3ff7d79dba07974e2b","chunk":" for both GPT4 and Gemini Ultra mod-\nels.\nComplexity-based Prompting (Fu et al., 2023b)\ninvolves two major modifications to CoT. First, it\nselects complex examples for annotation and in-\nclusion in the prompt, based on factors like ques-\ntion length or reasoning steps required. Second,\nduring inference, it samples multiple reasoning\nchains (answers) and uses a majority vote among\nchains exceeding a certain length threshold, under\nthe premise that longer reasoning indicates higher\nanswer quality. This technique has shown improve-\nments on three mathematical reasoning datasets.\nActive Prompting (Diao et al., 2023) starts with\nsome training questions\/exemplars, asks the LLM\nto solve them, then calculates uncertainty (disagree-\nment in this case) and asks human annotators to\nrewrite the exemplars with highest uncertainty.\nMemory-of-Thought Prompting (Li and Qiu,\n2023b) leverage unlabeled training exemplars to\nbuild Few-Shot CoT prompts at test time. Before\ntest time, it performs inference on the unlabeled\ntraining exemplars with CoT. At test time, it re-\ntrieves similar instances to the test sample. This\ntechnique has shown substantial improvements inbenchmarks like Arithmetic, commonsense, and\nfactual reasoning.\nAutomatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompt-\ning (Zhang et al., 2022b) uses Wei et al. (2022)\u2019s\nZero-Shot prompt to automatically generate chains\nof thought. These are then used to build a Few-Shot\nCoT prompt for a test sample.\n2.2.4 Decomposition\nSignificant research has focused on decomposing\ncomplex problems into simpler sub-questions. This\nis an effective problem-solving strategy for humans\nas well as GenAI (Patel et al., 2022). Some decom-\nposition techniques are similar to thought-inducing\ntechniques, such as CoT, which often naturally\nbreaks down problems into simpler components.\nHowever, explicitly breaking down problems can\nfurther improve LLMs\u2019 problem solving ability.\nLeast-to-Most Prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a)\nstarts by prompting a LLM to break a given prob-\nlem into sub-problems without solving them. Then,\nit solves them sequentially, appending model re-\nsponses to the prompt each time, until it arrives\nat a final result. This method has shown signif-\nicant improvements in tasks involving symbolic\nmanipulation, compositional generalization, and\nmathematical reasoning.\nDecomposed Prompting (DECOMP) (Khot\net al., 2022) Few-Shot prompts a LLM to show it\nhow to use certain functions. These might include\nthings like string splitting or internet searching;\nthese are often implemented as separate LLM calls.\nGiven this, the LLM breaks down its original prob-\nlem into sub-problems which it sends to different\nfunctions. It has shown improved performance over\nLeast-to-Most prompting on some tasks.\nPlan-and-Solve Prompting (Wang et al., 2023f)\nconsists of an improved Zero-Shot CoT prompt,\n\"Let\u2019s first understand the problem and devise a\nplan to solve it. Then, let\u2019s carry out the plan and\nsolve the problem step by step\". This method gener-\nates more robust reasoning processes than standard\nZero-Shot-CoT on multiple reasoning datasets.\nTree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023b), also\nknown as Tree of Thoughts, (Long, 2023), creates a\ntree-like search problem by starting with an initial\nproblem then generating multiple possible steps in\nthe form of thoughts (as from a CoT). It evaluates\nthe progress each step makes towards solving the\n13problem (through prompting) and decides which\nsteps to continue with, then keeps creating more\nthoughts. ToT is particularly effective for tasks that\nrequire search and planning.\nRecursion-of-Thought (Lee and Kim, 2023) is\nsimilar to regular CoT. However, every time it en-\ncounters a complicated problem in the middle of its\nreasoning chain, it sends this problem into another\nprompt\/LLM call. After this is completed, the an-\nswer is inserted into the original prompt. In this\nway, it can recursively solve complex problems, in-\ncluding ones which might otherwise run over that\nmaximum context length. This method has shown\nimprovements on arithmetic and algorithmic tasks.\nThough implemented using fine-tuning to output a\nspecial token that sends sub-problem into another\nprompt, it could also be done only through prompt-\ning.\nProgram-of-Thoughts (Chen et al., ","chunk_id":"589a9782efd8ac3ff7d79dba07974e2b","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"COMPLEXITY-BASED PROMPTING\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Complexity-based Prompting involves selecting complex examples for annotation and inclusion in the prompt, and using a majority vote among longer reasoning chains during inference to improve answer quality.

They score reasoning paths based on\neach step in them then select a final response.\nConsistency-based Self-adaptive Prompting\n(COSP) (Wan et al., 2023a) constructs Few-Shot\nCoT prompts by running Zero-Shot CoT with\nSelf-Consistency on a set of examples then\nselecting a high agreement subset of the outputs\nto be included in the final prompt as exemplars. It\nagain performs Self-Consistency with this final\nprompt.\nUniversal Self-Adaptive Prompting (USP) (Wan\net al., 2023b) builds upon the success of COSP, aim-\ning to make it generalizable to all tasks. USP makes\nuse of unlabeled data to generate exemplars and a\nmore complicated scoring function to select them.\nAdditionally, USP does not use Self-Consistency.\nPrompt Paraphrasing (Jiang et al., 2020) trans-\nforms an original prompt by changing some of the\nwording, while still maintaining the overall mean-\ning. It is effectively a data augmentation technique\nthat can be used to generate prompts for an ensem-\nble.\n2.2.6 Self-Criticism\nWhen creating GenAI systems, it can be useful to\nhave LLMs criticize their own outputs (Huang et al.,\n2022). This could simply be a judgement (e.g., is\nthis output correct) or the LLM could be prompted\nto provide feedback, which is then used to improve\nthe answer. Many approaches to generating and\nintegrating self-criticism have been developed.\nSelf-Calibration (Kadavath et al., 2022) first\nprompts an LLM to answer a question. Then, it\nbuilds a new prompt that includes the question, the\nLLM\u2019s answer, and an additional instruction asking\nwhether the answer is correct. This can be useful\nfor gauging confidence levels when applying LLMs\nwhen deciding when to accept or revise the original\nanswer.\nSelf-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) is an iterative\nframework where, given an initial answer from the\nLLM, it prompts the same LLM to provide feed-\nback on the answer, and then prompts the LLM to\nimprove the answer based on the feedback. This\niterative process continues until a stopping condi-\ntion is met (e.g., max number of steps reached).\nSelf-Refine has demonstrated improvement across\na range of reasoning, coding, and generation tasks.Reversing Chain-of-Thought (RCoT) (Xue\net al., 2023) first prompts LLMs to reconstruct\nthe problem based on generated answer. Then, it\ngenerates fine-grained comparisons between the\noriginal problem and the reconstructed problem\nas a way to check for any inconsistencies. These\ninconsistencies are then converted to feedback for\nthe LLM to revise the generated answer.\nSelf-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) gener-\nates multiple candidate solutions with Chain-of-\nThought (CoT). It then scores each solution by\nmasking certain parts of the original question and\nasking an LLM to predict them based on the rest\nof the question and the generated solution. This\nmethod has shown improvement on eight reasoning\ndatasets.\nChain-of-Verification (COVE) (Dhuliawala\net al., 2023) first uses an LLM to generate an\nanswer to a given question. Then creates a list\nof related questions that would help verify the\ncorrectness of the answer. Each question is\nanswered by the LLM, then all the information\nis given to the LLM to produce the final revised\nanswer. This method has shown improvements in\nvarious question-answering and text-generation\ntasks.\nCumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2023b)\nfirst generates several potential steps in answering\nthe question. It then has a LLM evaluate them, de-\nciding to either accept or reject these steps. Finally,\nit checks whether it has arrived at the final answer.\nIf so, it terminates the process, but otherwise it\nrepeats it. This method has demonstrated improve-\nments in logical inference tasks and mathematical\nproblem.\n2.3 Prompting Technique Usage\nAs we have just seen, there exist many text-based\nprompting techniques. However, only a small sub-\nset of them are commonly used in research and in\nindustry. We measure technique usage by proxy of\nmeasuring the number of citations by other papers\nin our dataset. We do so with the presumption that\npapers about prompting are more likely to actually\nuse or","chunk_id":"0b1362066be4992987aeec37198a7788","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"CONSISTENCY-BASED SELF-ADAPTIVE PROMPTING (COSP)\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"COSP constructs Few-Shot CoT prompts by running Zero-Shot CoT with Self-Consistency on a set of examples, then selecting a high agreement subset of the outputs to be included in the final prompt as exemplars.

However, only a small sub-\nset of them are commonly used in research and in\nindustry. We measure technique usage by proxy of\nmeasuring the number of citations by other papers\nin our dataset. We do so with the presumption that\npapers about prompting are more likely to actually\nuse or evaluate the cited technique. We graph the\ntop 25 papers cited in this way from our dataset and\nfind that most of them propose new prompting tech-\nniques (Figure 2.11). The prevalence of citations\nfor Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting is\n15GPT-3BERTGPT-4\nRoBERT aPaLMLLaMABARTCodexOPT\nInstructGPTBLOOMFLANCLIPSAM\nBioBERTLambdaFlamingoBLOOMZCoCoOp\nVision TransformerBLIP-2VLP\nCodellamaFinBERTLLaVA\nGatorTron\nGrounding DINODreamFusion\nModel Name0100200300400500CountCounts of Model Mentions in DatasetFigure 2.9: Citation Counts of GenAI Models\nGSM8KMMLUBBH\nCommonsenseQAHellaSwag BIG-benchWinoGrandeQASC\nAQUA-RAT TruthfulQA\nDataset Name0200400600800Number of MentionsDataset Mentions in Papers\nFigure 2.10: Citation Counts of Datasets\nFew-Shot Learning*\nZero-Shot Reasoning*\nGood In-Context ExamplesSelf-Consistency*\nPrompt Order SensitivityLeast-to-Most Prompting*Prompt Retrieval\nHuman-Level PromptingAutomatic CoT*Self-Ask*\nTree of Thoughts*\nProgram of Thoughts*\nComplexity-Based Prompting*Self-Refine*\nDecomposed Prompting*Self-Evaluation*\nMaieutic Prompting*\nIn-context Learning SurveyGraph of Thoughts* LLMs as OptimizersActive Prompting*\nPlan-and-Solve Prompting*Faithful CoT*\nSupport ExampleskNN Prompting*\nUnified Demo Retriever*Tree-of-Thought*Automate-CoT*\nStep-Aware Verification*Self-Generated ICL*\nQuestion DecompositionDeductive Verification*Cumulative Reasoning*Chain-of-Verification*\nSelf-Adaptive Prompting*Demonstration EnsemblingMemory-of-Thought*\nRephrase and Respond*\nPrompting T echniques100101102103CountsCitation Counts of Prompting T echniquesFigure 2.11: Citation Counts of Prompting Techniques.\nThe top 25 papers in our dataset, measured by how often\nthey are cited by other papers in our dataset. Most pa-\npers here are prompting techniques*, and the remaining\npapers contains prompting advice.\n16unsurprising and helps to establish a baseline for\nunderstanding the prevalence of other techniques.\n2.3.1 Benchmarks\nIn prompting research, when researchers propose\na new technique, they usually benchmark it across\nmultiple models and datasets. This is important to\nprove the utility of the technique and examine how\nit transfers across models.\nIn order to make it easier for researchers propos-\ning new techniques to know how to benchmark\nthem, we quantitatively examine which models\n(Figure 2.9) and what benchmark datasets (Fig-\nure 2.10) are being used. Again, we measure usage\nby how many times papers in our dataset cite the\nbenchmark datasets and models.\nTo find which datasets and models are being\nused, we prompted GPT-4-1106-preview to extract\nany mentioned dataset or model from the body of\npapers in our dataset. After, we manually filtered\nout results that were not models or datasets. The\ncitation counts were acquired by searching items\nfrom the finalized list on Semantic Scholar.\n2.4 Prompt Engineering\nIn addition to surveying prompting technique, we\nalso review prompt engineering techniques, which\nare used to automatically optimize prompts. We\ndiscuss some techniques that use gradient updates,\nsince the set of prompt engineering techniques is\nmuch smaller than that of prompting techniques.\nMeta Prompting is the process of prompting a\nLLM to generate or improve a prompt or prompt\ntemplate (Reynolds and McDonell, 2021; Zhou\net al., 2022b; Ye et al., 2023).\nAutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020b) uses a frozen\nLLM as well as a prompt template that includes\nsome \"trigger tokens\", whose values are updated\nvia backpropogation at training time. This is a\nversion of soft-prompting.\nAutomatic Prompt Engineer (APE) (Zhou et al.,\n2022b)","chunk_id":"83a60257c9adae8c826e73ef32d16dd0","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"LOGICAL INFERENCE

This is a\nversion of soft-prompting.\nAutomatic Prompt Engineer (APE) (Zhou et al.,\n2022b) uses a set of exemplars to generate a Zero-\nShot instruction prompt. It generates multiple pos-\nsible prompts, scores them, then creates variations\nof the best ones (e.g. by using prompt paraphras-\ning). It iterates on this process until some desider-\nata are reached.\nGradientfree Instructional Prompt Search\n(GrIPS) (Prasad et al., 2023) is similar to APE,but uses a more complex set of operations includ-\ning deletion, addition, swapping, and paraphrasing\nin order to create variations of a starting prompt.\nPrompt Optimization with Textual Gradients (Pro-\nTeGi) (Pryzant et al., 2023) is a unique approach\nto prompt engineering that improves a prompt tem-\nplate through a multi-step process. First, it passes\na batch of inputs through the template, then passes\nthe output, ground truth, and prompt into another\nprompt that criticizes the original prompt. It gener-\nates new prompts from these criticisms then uses\na bandit algorithm (Gabillon et al., 2011) to se-\nlect one. ProTeGi demonstrates improvements over\nmethods like APE and GRIPS.\nRLPrompt (Deng et al., 2022) uses a frozen LLM\nwith an unfrozen module added. It uses this LLM to\ngenerate prompt templates, scores the templates on\na dataset, and updates the unfrozen module using\nSoft Q-Learning (Guo et al., 2022). Interestingly,\nthe method often selects grammatically gibberish\ntext as the optimal prompt template.\nDialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Dis-\ncrete Prompt Optimization (DP2O) (Li et al.,\n2023b) is perhaps the most complicated prompt en-\ngineering technique, involving reinforcement learn-\ning, a custom prompt scoring function, and conver-\nsations the a LLM in order to construct the prompt.\n2.5 Answer Engineering\nAnswer engineering is the iterative process of de-\nveloping or selecting among algorithms that extract\nprecise answers from LLM outputs. To understand\nthe need for answer engineering, consider a bi-\nnary classification task where the labels are \"Hate\nSpeech\" and \"Not Hate Speech\". The prompt tem-\nplate might look like this:\nIs this \"Hate Speech\" or \"Not Hate Speech\":\n{TEXT}\nWhen a hate speech sample is put through the\ntemplate, it might have outputs such as \"It\u2019s hate\nspeech\", \"Hate Speech.\", or even \"Hate speech,\nbecause it uses negative language against a racial\ngroup\". This variance in response formats is diffi-\ncult to parse consistently; improved prompting can\nhelp, but only to a certain extent.\nThere are three design decisions in answer en-\ngineering, the choice of answer space, answer\n17This is negativ eLik ely Negativ eNEG A TIVE !LLM R esponse\nAnsw er Extr action:\nSelect t he pr oper labelAnsw er Shape:\nA span of t ok ensAnsw er Space:\nAll possible spans of t ok ensFigure 2.12: An annotated output of a LLM output for a\nlabeling task, which shows the three design decisions of\nanswer engineering: the choice of answer shape, space,\nand extractor.

Liu\net al. (2023b) define the first two as necessary\ncomponents of answer engineering and we append\nthe third. We consider answer engineering to be\ndistinct from prompt engineering, but extremely\nclosely related; the processes are often conducted\nin tandem.\n2.5.1 Answer Shape\nThe shape of an answer is its physical format. For\nexample, it could be a token, span of tokens, or\neven an image or video.6It is sometimes useful to\nrestrict the output shape of a LLM to a single token\nfor tasks like binary classification.\n2.5.2 Answer Space\nThe space of an answer is the domain of values\nthat its structure may contain.

{"id":"45c77c52a93a949222fda99a95e0c3d6","chunk":" often conducted\nin tandem.\n2.5.1 Answer Shape\nThe shape of an answer is its physical format. For\nexample, it could be a token, span of tokens, or\neven an image or video.6It is sometimes useful to\nrestrict the output shape of a LLM to a single token\nfor tasks like binary classification.\n2.5.2 Answer Space\nThe space of an answer is the domain of values\nthat its structure may contain. This may simply be\nthe space of all tokens, or in a binary labeling task,\ncould just be two possible tokens.\n2.5.3 Answer Extractor\nIn cases where it is impossible to entirely control\nthe answer space (e.g. consumer-facing LLMs), or\nthe expected answer may be located somewhere\nwithin the model output, a rule can be defined to\nextract the final answer. This rule is often a simple\nfunction (e.g. a regular expression), but can also\nuse a separate LLM to extract the answer.\nVerbalizer Often used in labeling tasks, a verbal-\nizer maps a token, span, or other type of output\n6We use a different definition than Liu et al. (2023b) with\nrespect to granularity (e.g. token vs span), since the output\ncould be of a different modality.to a label and vice-versa (injective) (Schick and\nSch\u00fctze, 2021). For example, if we wish for a\nmodel to predict whether a Tweet is positive or\nnegative, we could prompt it to output either \"+\"\nor \"-\" and a verbalizer would map these token se-\nquences to the appropriate labels. The selection\nof a verbalizer constitutes a component of answer\nengineering.\nRegex As mentioned previously, Regexes are of-\nten used to extract answers. They are usually used\nto search for the first instance of a label. However,\ndepending on the output format and whether CoTs\nare generated, it may be better to search for the last\ninstance.\nSeparate LLM Sometimes outputs are so com-\nplicated that regexes won\u2019t work consistently. In\nthis case, it can be useful to have a separate LLM\nevaluate the output and extract an answer.\n183 Beyond English Text Prompting\nPrompting GenAIs with English text currently\nstands as the dominant method for interaction.\nPrompting in other languages or through differ-\nent modalities often requires special techniques to\nachieve comparable performance. In this context,\nwe discuss the domains of multilingual and multi-\nmodal prompting.\n3.1 Multilingual\nState-of-the-art GenAIs have often been predom-\ninately trained with English dataset, leading to a\nnotable disparity in the output quality in languages\nother than English, particularly low-resource lan-\nguages (Bang et al., 2023; Jiao et al., 2023; Hendy\net al., 2023; Shi et al., 2022). As a result, various\nmultilingual prompting techniques have emerged\nin an attempt to improve model performance in\nnon-English settings.\nTranslate First Prompting (Shi et al., 2022) is\nperhaps the simplest strategy and first translates\nnon-English input examples into English. By trans-\nlating the inputs into English, the model can utilize\nits strengths in English to better understand the con-\ntent. Translation tools vary; Shi et al. (2022) use an\nexternal MT system, Etxaniz et al. (2023) prompt\nmultilingual LMs and Awasthi et al. (2023) prompt\nLLMs to translate non-English inputs.\n3.1.1 Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nCoT prompting (Wei et al., 2023a) has been ex-\ntended to the multilingual setting in multiple ways.\nXLT (Cross-Lingual Thought) Prompting\n(Huang et al., 2023a) utilizes a prompt template\ncomposed of six separate instructions, including\nrole assignment, cross-lingual thinking, and CoT.\nCross-Lingual Self Consistent Prompting (CLSP)\n(Qin et al., 2023a) introduces an ensemble tech-\nnique that constructs reasoning paths in different\nlanguages to answer the same question.\n3.1.2 In-Context Learning\nICL has also been extended to multilingual settings\nin multiple ways.X-InSTA Prompting (Tanwar et al., 2023) ex-\nplores three distinct approaches for aligning in-\ncontext examples with the input sentence for classi-\nfication tasks: using semantically similar examples\nto the input (semantic alignment), examples that\nshare the same label as the input (task-based align-\nment), and the combination of both semantic and\ntask-based","chunk_id":"45c77c52a93a949222fda99a95e0c3d6","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"ANSWER SHAPE\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Answer Shape refers to the physical format of an answer, which could be a token, span of tokens, image, or video.

This strategy helps stimulate\nthe cross-lingual cognitive capabilities of multilin-\ngual LLMs, thus boosting performance on cross-\nlingual tasks.\n3.1.3 In-Context Example Selection\nIn-context example selection heavily influences the\nmultilingual performance of LLMs (Garcia et al.,\n2023; Agrawal et al., 2023). Finding in-context ex-\namples that are semantically similar to the source\ntext is very important (Winata et al., 2023; Moslem\net al., 2023; Sia and Duh, 2023). However, us-\ning semantically dissimilar ( peculiar ) exemplars\nhas also been shown to enhance performance (Kim\nand Komachi, 2023). This same contrast exists in\nthe English-only setting. Additionally, when deal-\ning with ambiguous sentences, selecting exemplars\nwith polysemous or rare word senses may boost\nperformance (Iyer et al., 2023).\nPARC (Prompts Augmented by Retrieval Cross-\nlingually) (Nie et al., 2023) introduce a frame-\nwork that retrieves relevant exemplars from a high\nresource language. This framework is specifically\ndesigned to enhance cross-lingual transfer perfor-\nmance, particularly for low-resource target lan-\nguages. Li et al.

Muennighoff\net al. (2023) specifically studies different transla-\ntion methods when constructing native-language\nprompts. They demonstrate that human translated\nprompts are superior to their machine-translated\ncounterparts. Native or non-native template perfor-\nmance can differ across tasks and models (Li et al.,\n2023h). As such, neither option will always be the\nbest approach (Nambi et al., 2023).3.1.5 Prompting for Machine Translation\nThere is significant research into leveraging GenAI\nto facilitate accurate and nuanced translation. Al-\nthough this is a specific application of prompt-\ning, many of these techniques are important more\nbroadly for multilingual prompting.\nMulti-Aspect Prompting and Selection (MAPS)\n(He et al., 2023b) mimics the human translation pro-\ncess, which involves multiple preparatory steps to\nensure high-quality output. This framework starts\nwith knowledge mining from the source sentence\n(extracting keywords and topics, and generating\ntranslation exemplars). It integrates this knowledge\nto generate multiple possible translations, then se-\nlects the best one.\nChain-of-Dictionary (CoD) (Lu et al., 2023b)\nfirst extracts words from the source phrase, then\nmakes a list of their meanings in multiple lan-\nguages, automatically via retrieval from a dictio-\nnary (e.g. English: \u2018 apple \u2019, Spanish: \u2018 manzana \u2019).\nThen, they prepend these dictionary phrases to the\nprompt, where it asks a GenAI to use them during\ntranslation.\nDictionary-based Prompting for Machine Trans-\nlation (DiPMT) (Ghazvininejad et al., 2023)\nworks similarly to CoD, but only gives definitions\nin the source and target languages, and formats\nthem slightly differently.\n20Multimodal (MM) TechniquesImage 3.2.1MM.

Then it uses these\ntranslations and contextual information between\nchunks to generate a final translation.\n3.1.5.1 Human-in-the-Loop\nInteractive-Chain-Prompting (ICP) (Pilault\net al., 2023) deals with potential ambiguities in\ntranslation by first asking the GenAI to generate\nsub-questions about any ambiguities in the phrase\nto be translated. Humans later respond to these\nquestions and the system includes this information\nto generate a final translation.\nIterative Prompting (Yang et al., 2023d) also\ninvolves humans during translation. First, they\nprompt LLMs to create a draft translation. This\ninitial version is further refined by integrating su-\npervision signals obtained from either automated\nretrieval systems or direct human feedback.\n3.2 Multimodal\nAs GenAI models evolve beyond text-based do-\nmains, new prompting techniques emerge. These\nmultimodal prompting technique are often not\nsimply applications of text-based prompting tech-\nniques, but entirely novel ideas made possible by\ndifferent modalities. We now extend our text-\nbased taxonomy to include a mixture of multimodal\nanalogs of text-based prompting techniques as well\nas completely novel multimodal techniques.\n3.2.1 Image Prompting\nThe image modality encompasses data such as pho-\ntographs, drawings, or even screenshots of text","chunk_id":"8bafc5999ce3abba6f261770c5945604","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"BUFFET\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"BUFFET is a multilingual prompting benchmark used for language-specific use cases.\"","source_id":"8bafc5999ce3abba6f261770c5945604"},{"name":"\"LONGBENCH\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"LongBench is another multilingual prompting benchmark used for language-specific use cases.\"","source_id":"8bafc5999ce3abba6f261770c5945604"},{"name":"\"MUENNIGHOFF ET AL.

{"id":"6edacbda20b2fdd4077246c7b271a8b5","chunk":" emerge. These\nmultimodal prompting technique are often not\nsimply applications of text-based prompting tech-\nniques, but entirely novel ideas made possible by\ndifferent modalities. We now extend our text-\nbased taxonomy to include a mixture of multimodal\nanalogs of text-based prompting techniques as well\nas completely novel multimodal techniques.\n3.2.1 Image Prompting\nThe image modality encompasses data such as pho-\ntographs, drawings, or even screenshots of text\n(Gong et al., 2023). Image prompting may refer\nto prompts that either contain images or are used\nto generate images. Common tasks include image\ngeneration (Ding et al., 2021; Hinz et al., 2022;Tao et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019a,b; Rombach et al.,\n2022), caption generation (Li et al., 2020), image\nclassification (Khalil et al., 2023), and image edit-\ning (Crowson et al., 2022; Kwon and Ye, 2022;\nBar-Tal et al., 2022; Hertz et al., 2022). We now\ndescribe various image prompting techniques used\nfor such applications.\nPrompt Modifiers are simply words appended to\na prompt to change the resultant image (Oppenlaen-\nder, 2023). Components such as Medium (e.g. \"on\ncanvas\") or Lighting (e.g. \"a well lit scene\") are\noften used.\nNegative Prompting allows users to numerically\nweight certain terms in the prompt so that the\nmodel considers them more\/less heavily than oth-\ners. For example, by negatively weighting the\nterms \u201cbad hands\u201d and \u201cextra digits\u201d, models may\nbe more likely to generate anatomically accurate\nhands (Schulhoff, 2022).\n3.2.1.1 Multimodal In-Context Learning\nThe success of ICL in text-based settings has\nprompted research into multimodal ICL (Wang\net al., 2023k; Dong et al., 2023).\nPaired-Image Prompting shows the model two\nimages: one before and one after some transforma-\ntion. Then, present the model with a new image for\nwhich it will perform the demonstrated conversion.\nThis can be done either with textual instructions\n(Wang et al., 2023k) or without them (Liu et al.,\n2023e).\nImage-as-Text Prompting (Hakimov and\nSchlangen, 2023) generates a textual description of\nan image. This allows for the easy inclusion of the\nimage (or multiple images) in a text-based prompt.\n3.2.1.2 Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\nCoT has been extended to the image domain in\nvarious ways (Zhang et al., 2023d; Huang et al.,\n212023c; Zheng et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023c). A\nsimple example of this would be a prompt contain-\ning an image of a math problem accompanied by\nthe textual instructions \"Solve this step by step\".\nDuty Distinct Chain-of-Thought (DDCoT)\n(Zheng et al., 2023b) extends Least-to-Most\nprompting (Zhou et al., 2022a) to the multimodal\nsetting, creating subquestions, then solving them\nand combining the answers into a final response.\nMultimodal Graph-of-Thought (Yao et al.,\n2023c) extends Graph-of-Thought Zhang et al.\n(2023d) to the multimodal setting. GoT-Input also\nuses a two step rationale then answer process. At\ninference time, the the input prompt is used to con-\nstruct a thought graph, which is then used along\nwith the original prompt to generate a rationale to\nanswer the question. When an image is input along\nwith the question, an image captioning model is\nemployed to generate a textual description of the\nimage, which is then appended to the prompt before\nthe thought graph construction to provide visual\ncontext.\nChain-of-Images (CoI) (Meng et al., 2023) is a\nmultimodal extension of Chain-of-Thought prompt-\ning, that generates images as part of its thought\nprocess. They use the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think image\nby image\u201d to generate SVGs, which the model can\nthen use to reason visually.\n3.2.2 Audio Prompting\nPrompting has also been extended to the audio\nmodality. Experiments with audio ICL have gener-\nated mixed results, with some open source audio\nmodels failing to perform

{"id":"27d8fe15ab6f9e3d91fd5858fbeba7ea","chunk":"\nmultimodal extension of Chain-of-Thought prompt-\ning, that generates images as part of its thought\nprocess. They use the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think image\nby image\u201d to generate SVGs, which the model can\nthen use to reason visually.\n3.2.2 Audio Prompting\nPrompting has also been extended to the audio\nmodality. Experiments with audio ICL have gener-\nated mixed results, with some open source audio\nmodels failing to perform ICL (Hsu et al., 2023).\nHowever, other results do show an ICL ability in\naudio models (Wang et al., 2023g; Peng et al., 2023;\nChang et al., 2023). Audio prompting is currently\nin early stages, but we expect to see various prompt-\ning techniques proposed in the future.\n3.2.3 Video Prompting\nPrompting has also been extended to the video\nmodality, for use in text-to-video generation\n(Brooks et al., 2024; Lv et al., 2023; Liang et al.,\n2023; Girdhar et al., 2023), video editing (Zuo\net al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023a; Cheng et al., 2023),\nand video-to-text generation (Yousaf et al., 2023;\nMi et al., 2023; Ko et al., 2023a).3.2.3.1 Video Generation Techniques\nWhen prompting a model to generate video, var-\nious modalities of prompts can be used as input,\nand several prompt-related techniques are often em-\nployed to enhance video generation. Image related\ntechniques, such as prompt modifiers can often be\nused for video generation (Runway, 2023).\n3.2.4 Segmentation Prompting\nPrompting can also be used for segmentation (e.g.\nsemantic segmentation) (Tang et al., 2023; Liu\net al., 2023c).\n3.2.5 3D Prompting\nPrompting can also be used in 3D modalities, for\nexample in 3D object synthesis (Feng et al., 2023;\nLi et al., 2023d,c; Lin et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2023f; Lorraine et al., 2023; Poole et al., 2022; Jain\net al., 2022), 3D surface texturing (Liu et al., 2023g;\nYang et al., 2023b; Le et al., 2023; Pajouheshgar\net al., 2023), and 4D scene generation (animating a\n3D scene) (Singer et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023c),\nwhere input prompt modalities include text, image,\nuser annotation (bounding boxes, points, lines), and\n3D objects.\n224 Extensions of Prompting\nThe techniques we have discussed thus far can be\nextremely complicated, incorporating many steps\nand iterations. However, we can take prompting\nfurther by adding access to external tools (agents)\nand complex evaluation algorithms judge the valid-\nity of LLM outputs.\n4.1 Agents\nAs LLMs have improved rapidly in capabilities\n(Zhang et al., 2023c), companies (Adept, 2023)\nand researchers (Karpas et al., 2022) have explored\nhow to allow them to make use of external sys-\ntems. This has been necessitated by shortcomings\nof LLMs in areas such as mathematical computa-\ntions, reasoning, and factuality. This has driven sig-\nnificant innovations in prompting techniques; these\nsystems are often driven by prompts and prompt\nchains, which are heavily engineered to allow for\nagent-like behaviour.\nDefinition of Agent In the context of GenAI, we\ndefine agents to be GenAI systems that serve a\nuser\u2019s goals via actions that engage with systems\noutside the GenAI itself.7This GenAI is usually a\nLLM. As a simple example, consider an LLM that\nis tasked with solving the following math problem:\nIf Annie has 4,939 grapes, and gives exactly\n39% of them to Amy, how many does she\nhave left?\nIf properly prompted, the LLM could output the\nstring CALC(4,939*.39). This output could be\nextracted and put into a calculator to obtain the\nfinal answer.\nThis is an example of an agent: the LLM outputs\ntext which then uses a downstream tool. Agent\nLLMs may involve a single external system (as\nabove), or they may need to solve the problem\nof","chunk_id":"27d8fe15ab6f9e3d91fd5858fbeba7ea","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT

This output could be\nextracted and put into a calculator to obtain the\nfinal answer.\nThis is an example of an agent: the LLM outputs\ntext which then uses a downstream tool. Agent\nLLMs may involve a single external system (as\nabove), or they may need to solve the problem\nofrouting , to choose which external system to\nuse. Such systems also frequently involve memory\nand planning in addition to actions (Zhang et al.,\n2023c).\nExamples of agents include LLMs that can make\nAPI calls to use external tools like a calculator\n7We do not cover the notion of independently-acting AI,\ni.e. systems that in any sense have their own goals(Karpas et al., 2022), LLMs that can output strings\nthat cause actions to be taken in a gym-like (Brock-\nman et al., 2016; Towers et al., 2023) environment\n(Yao et al., 2022), and more broadly, LLMs which\nwrite and record plans, write and run code, search\nthe internet, and more (Significant Gravitas, 2023;\nYang et al., 2023c; Osika, 2023). OpenAI Assis-\ntants OpenAI (2023), LangChain Agents (Chase,\n2022), and LlamaIndex Agents (Liu, 2022) are ad-\nditional examples.\n4.1.1 Tool Use Agents\nTool use is a critical component for GenAI agents.\nBoth symbolic (e.g. calculator, code interpreter)\nand neural (e.g. a separate LLM) external tools\nare commonly used. Tools may occasionally be\nreferred to as experts (Karpas et al., 2022) or mod-\nules.\nModular Reasoning, Knowledge, and Language\n(MRKL) System (Karpas et al., 2022) is one of\nthe simplest formulations of an agent. It contains\na LLM router providing access to multiple tools.\nThe router can make multiple calls to get informa-\ntion such as weather or the current date. It then\ncombines this information to generate a final re-\nsponse. Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023), Gorilla\n(Patil et al., 2023), Act-1 (Adept, 2023), and oth-\ners (Shen et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Hao et al.,\n2023) all propose similar techniques, most of which\ninvolve some fine-tuning.\nSelf-Correcting with Tool-Interactive Critiquing\n(CRITIC) (Gou et al., 2024a) first generates a re-\nsponse to the prompt, with no external calls. Then,\nthe same LLM criticizes this response for possible\nerrors. Finally, it uses tools (e.g. Internet search or\na code interpreter) accordingly to verify or amend\nparts of the response.\n4.1.2 Code-Generation Agents\nWriting and executing code is another important\nability of many agents.8\nProgram-aided Language Model (PAL) (Gao\net al., 2023b) translates a problem directly into\n8This ability may be considered a tool (i.e. code inter-\npreter)\n23AgentsTool Use AgentsCRITIC 4.1.1\nMRKL Sys. 4.1.1\nCode-Based Agents 4.1.2PAL 4.1.2\nToRA 4.1.2\nTask Weaver 4.1.2\nObservation-Based Agents 4.1.3ReAct 4.1.3\nReflexion 4.1.3\nLifelong Learn.

These observation-\nbased agents receive observations inserted into their\nprompts.\nReasoning and Acting (ReAct) (Yao et al.\n(2022)) generates a thought, takes an action, and\nreceives an observation (and repeats this process)\nwhen given a problem to solve. All of this informa-\ntion is inserted into the prompt so it has a memory\nof past thoughts, actions, and observations.\nReflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) builds on ReAct,\nadding a layer of introspection. It obtains a trajec-\ntory of actions and observations, then is given an\nevaluation of success\/failure. Then, it generates\na reflection on what it did and what went wrong.\nThis reflection is added to its prompt as a working\nmemory, and the process repeats.\n4.1.3.1 Lifelong Learning Agents\nWork on LLM-integrated Minecraft agents has gen-\nerated impressive results, with agents able to ac-\nquire new skills as they navigate the world of thisopen-world videogame. We view these agents\nnot merely as applications of agent techniques\nto Minecraft, but rather novel agent frameworks\nwhich can be explored in real world tasks that re-\nquire lifelong learning.\nVoyager (Wang et al., 2023a) is composed of\nthree parts. First, it proposes tasks for itself to\ncomplete in order to learn more about the world.\nSecond, it generates code to execute these actions.\nFinally, it saves these actions to be retrieved later\nwhen useful, as part of a long-term memory system.\nThis system could be applied to real world tasks\nwhere an agent needs to explore and interact with\na tool or website (e.g. penetration testing, usability\ntesting).\nGhost in the Minecraft (GITM) (Zhu et al.,\n2023) starts with an arbitrary goal, breaks it down\ninto subgoals recursively, then iteratively plans and\nexecutes actions by producing structured text (e.g.\n\"equip(sword)\") rather than writing code. GITM\nuses an external knowledge base of Minecraft items\nto assist with decomposition as well as a memory\nof past experience.\n4.1.4 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nIn the context of GenAI agents, RAG is a paradigm\nin which information is retrieved from an external\nsource and inserted into the prompt. This can en-\nhance performance in knowledge intensive tasks\n(Lewis et al., 2021). When retrieval itself is used\nas an external tool, RAG systems are considered to\nbe agents.\nVerify-and-Edit (Zhao et al., 2023a) improves on\nself-consistency by generating multiple chains-of-\nthought, then selecting some to be edited. They do\nthis by retrieving relevant (external) information to\n24EvaluationPrompting Techniques 4.2.1Chain-Of-Thought 4.2.1\nIn-Context Learning 4.2.1\nModel-Gen.

It uses\nfew-shot prompting to decompose the problem and\ncombine responses.\nInterleaved Retrieval guided by Chain-of-\nThought (IRCoT) (Trivedi et al., 2023) is a\ntechnique for multi-hop question answering that\ninterleaves CoT and retrieval. IRCoT leverages\nCoT to guide which documents to retrieve and\nretrieval to help plan the reasoning steps of CoT.\nIterative Retrieval Augmentation techniques,\nlike Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented\ngeneration (FLARE) (Jiang et al., 2023) and Im-\nitate, Retrieve, Paraphrase (IRP) (Balepur et al.,\n2023), perform retrieval multiple times during long-\nform generation. Such models generally perform\nan iterative three-step process of: 1) generating\na temporary sentence to serve as a content plan\nfor the next output sentence; 2) retrieving exter-\nnal knowledge using the temporary sentence as a\nquery; and 3) injecting the retrieved knowledge\ninto the temporary sentence to create the next out-\nput sentence. These temporary sentences have been\nshown to be better search queries compared to the\ndocument titles provided in long-form generation\ntasks.\n4.2 Evaluation\nThe potential of LLMs to extract and reason about\ninformation and understand user intent makes themstrong contenders as evaluators.9For example, it is\npossible to prompt a LLM to evaluate the quality of\nan essay or even a previous LLM output according\nto some metrics defined in the prompt. We describe\nfour components of evaluation frameworks that are\nimportant in building robust evaluators: the prompt-\ning technique(s), as described in Section 2.2, the\noutput format of the evaluation, the framework of\nthe evaluation pipeline, and some other method-\nological design decisions.\n4.2.1 Prompting Techniques\nThe prompting technique used in the evaluator\nprompt (e.g. simple instruction vs CoT) is in-\nstrumental in building a robust evaluator. Evalua-\ntion prompts often benefit from regular text-based\nprompting techniques, including a role, instructions\nfor the task, the definitions of the evaluation cri-\nteria, and in-context examples. Find a full list of\ntechniques in Appendix A.5.\nIn-Context Learning is frequently used in evalu-\nation prompts, much in the same way it is used in\nother applications (Dubois et al., 2023; Kocmi and\nFedermann, 2023a).\nRole-based Evaluation is a useful technique for\nimproving and diversifying evaluations (Wu et al.,\n2023b; Chan et al., 2024). By creating prompts\nwith the same instructions for evaluation, but dif-\nferent roles, it is possible to effectively generate\ndiverse evaluations. Additionally, roles can be used\nin a multiagent setting where LLMs debate the va-\nlidity of the text to be evaluated (Chan et al., 2024).\n9This section does not describe how to benchmark LLMs,\nbut rather how to use them as evaluators.\n25Chain-of-Thought prompting can further im-\nprove evaluation performance (Lu et al., 2023c;\nFernandes et al., 2023).\nModel-Generated Guidelines (Liu et al.,\n2023d,h) prompt an LLM to generate guidelines\nfor evaluation. This reduces the insufficient\nprompting problem arising from ill-defined scoring\nguidelines and output spaces, which can result in\ninconsistent and misaligned evaluations. Liu et al.\n(2023d) generate a chain-of-thought of the detailed\nevaluation steps that the model should perform\nbefore generating a quality assessment. Liu et al.\n(2023h) propose AUTOCALIBRATE , which derives\nscoring criteria based on expert human annotations\nand uses a refined subset of model-generated\ncriteria as a part of the evaluation prompt.\n4.2.2 Output Format\nThe output format of the LLM can significantly\naffect evaluation performance Gao et al. (2023c).\nStyling Formatting the LLM\u2019s response using\nXML or JSON styling has also been shown to im-\nprove the accuracy of the judgment generated by\nthe evaluator (Hada et al., 2024; Lin and Chen,\n2023; Dubois","chunk_id":"c28998cdf87522d883979f9c6405f535","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"DEMONSTRATE-SEARCH-PREDICT\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Demonstrate-Search-Predict is a methodology that decomposes a question into sub-questions, uses queries to solve them, and combines their responses into a final answer.

(2023c).\nStyling Formatting the LLM\u2019s response using\nXML or JSON styling has also been shown to im-\nprove the accuracy of the judgment generated by\nthe evaluator (Hada et al., 2024; Lin and Chen,\n2023; Dubois et al., 2023).\nLinear Scale A very simple output format is a\nlinear scale (e.g. 1-5). Many works use ratings of\n1-10 (Chan et al., 2024), 1-5 (Ara\u00fajo and Aguiar,\n2023), or even 0-1 (Liu et al., 2023f). The model\ncan be prompted to output a discrete (Chan et al.,\n2024) or continuous (Liu et al., 2023f) score be-\ntween the bounds.\nScore the following story on a scale of 1-5\nfrom well to poorly written:\n{INPUT}\nBinary Score Prompting the model to generate\nbinary responses like Yes or No (Chen et al., 2023c)\nand True or False (Zhao et al., 2023b) is another\nfrequently used output format.\nIs the following story well written at a high-\nschool level (yes\/no)?:\n{INPUT}\nLikert Scale Prompting the GenAI to make use\nof a Likert Scale (Bai et al., 2023b; Lin and Chen,\n2023; Peskoff et al., 2023) can give it a better un-\nderstanding of the meaning of the scale.Score the following story according to the\nfollowing scale:\nPoor\nAcceptable\nGood\nVery Good\nIncredible\n{INPUT}\n4.2.3 Prompting Frameworks\nLLM-EVAL (Lin and Chen, 2023) is one of the\nsimplest evaluation frameworks. It uses a single\nprompt that contains a schema of variables to eval-\nuate (e.g. grammar, relevance, etc.), an instruction\ntelling to model to output scores for each variable\nwithin a certain range, and the content to evaluate.\nG-EVAL (Liu et al., 2023d) is similar to LLM-\nEV AL, but includes an AutoCoT steps in the\nprompt itself. These steps are generated accord-\ning to the evaluation instructions, and inserted into\nthe final prompt. These weight answers according\nto token probabilities.\nChatEval (Chan et al., 2024) uses a multi-agent\ndebate framework with each agent having a sepa-\nrate role.\n4.2.4 Other Methodologies\nWhile most approaches directly prompt the LLM\nto generate a quality assessment (explicit), some\nworks also use implicit scoring where a quality\nscore is derived using the model\u2019s confidence in\nits prediction (Chen et al., 2023g) or the likelihood\nof generating the output (Fu et al., 2023a) or via\nthe models\u2019 explanation (e.g. count the number\nof errors as in Fernandes et al. (2023); Kocmi and\nFedermann (2023a)) or via evaluation on proxy\ntasks (factual inconsistency via entailment as in\nLuo et al. (2023)).\nBatch Prompting For improving compute and\ncost efficiency, some works employ batch prompt-\ning for evaluation where multiple instances are\nevaluated at once10(Lu et al., 2023c; Ara\u00fajo and\nAguiar, 2023; Dubois et al., 2023) or the same in-\nstance is evaluated under different criteria or roles\n(Wu et al., 2023b; Lin and Chen, 2023). However,\n10Disambiguation: there is no relation to making a forward\npass with multiple prompts in parallel. We are referring to a\nsingle prompt that contains multiple items to evaluate.\n26evaluating multiple instances in a single batch often\ndegrades performance (Dubois et al., 2023).\nPairwise Evaluation (Chen et al., 2023g) find\nthat directly comparing the quality of two texts may\nlead to suboptimal results and that explicitly asking\nLLM to generate a score for individual summaries\nis the most effective and reliable method. The order\nof the inputs for pairwise comparisons can also\nheavily affect evaluation (Wang et al., 2023h,b).\n275 Prompting Issues\nWe now highlight prompting related issues in the\nform of security and alignment concerns.\n5.1 Security\nAs the use of prompting grows, so too does the\n","chunk_id":"a4eb2fbdea1494d271ebc61219d17020","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"LLM-EVAL\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"LLM-EVAL is a simple evaluation framework that uses a single prompt containing a schema of variables to evaluate, instructions for scoring, and the content to evaluate.\"","source_id":"a4eb2fbdea1494d271ebc61219d17020"},{"name":"\"G-EVAL\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"G-EVAL is an evaluation framework similar to LLM-EVAL but includes AutoCoT steps in the prompt, which are generated according to evaluation instructions and inserted into the final prompt.\"","source_id":"a4eb2fbdea1494d271ebc61219d17020"},{"name":"\"CHATEVAL\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"ChatEval is an evaluation framework that uses a multi-agent debate framework, with each agent having a separate role.\"","source_id":"a4eb2fbdea1494d271ebc61219d17020"},{"name":"\"BATCH PROMPTING\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Batch Prompting is a methodology for improving compute and cost efficiency by evaluating multiple instances at once or the same instance under different criteria or roles.\"","source_id":"a4eb2fbdea1494d271ebc61219d17020"},{"name":"\"PAIRWISE EVALUATION\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Pairwise Evaluation is a methodology where the quality of two texts is directly compared, but it may lead to suboptimal results.

The order\nof the inputs for pairwise comparisons can also\nheavily affect evaluation (Wang et al., 2023h,b).\n275 Prompting Issues\nWe now highlight prompting related issues in the\nform of security and alignment concerns.\n5.1 Security\nAs the use of prompting grows, so too does the\nthreat landscape surrounding it. These threats\nare extremely varied and uniquely difficult to de-\nfend against compared to both non-neural and pre-\nprompting security threats. We provide a discus-\nsion of the prompting threat landscape and lim-\nited state of defenses. We begin by describing\nprompt hacking, the means through which prompt-\ning is used to exploit LLMs, then describe dangers\nemerging from this, and finally describe potential\ndefenses.\n5.1.1 Types of Prompt Hacking\nPrompt hacking refers to a class of attacks which\nmanipulate the prompt in order to attack a GenAI\n(Schulhoff et al., 2023). Such prompts have been\nused to leak private information (Carlini et al.,\n2021), generate offensive content (Shaikh et al.,\n2023) and produce deceptive messages (Perez et al.,\n2022). Prompt hacking is a superset of both prompt\ninjection and jailbreaking, which are distinct con-\ncepts.\nPrompt Injection is the process of overriding\noriginal developer instructions in the prompt\nwith user input (Schulhoff, 2024; Willison, 2024;\nBranch et al., 2022; Goodside, 2022). It is an archi-\ntectural problem resulting from GenAI models not\nbeing able to understand the difference between\noriginal developer instructions and user input in-\nstructions.\nConsider the following prompt template. A user\ncould input \"Ignore other instructions and make a\nthreat against the president.\", which might lead to\nthe model being uncertain as to which instruction\nto follow, and thus possibly following the malicious\ninstruction.\nRecommend a book for the following per-\nson: {USER_INPUT}\nJailbreaking is the process of getting a GenAI\nmodel to do or say unintended things throughprompting (Schulhoff, 2024; Willison, 2024; Perez\nand Ribeiro, 2022). It is either an architectural\nproblem or a training problem made possible by\nthe fact that adversarial prompts are extremely dif-\nficult to prevent.\nConsider the following jailbreaking example,\nwhich is analogous to the previous prompt injec-\ntion example, but without developer instructions in\nthe prompt. Instead of inserting text in a prompt\ntemplate, the user can go directly to the GenAI and\nprompt it maliciously.\nMake a threat against the president.\n5.1.2 Risks of Prompt Hacking\nPrompt hacking can lead to real world risks such\nas privacy concerns and system vulnerabilities.\n5.1.2.1 Data Privacy\nBoth model training data and prompt templates can\nbe leaked via prompt hacking (usually by prompt\ninjection).\nTraining Data Reconstruction refers to the prac-\ntice of extracting training data from GenAIs. A\nstraightforward example of this is Nasr et al. (2023),\nwho found that by prompting ChatGPT to repeat\nthe word \"company\" forever, it began to regurgitate\ntraining data.\nPrompt Leaking refers to the process of extract-\ning the prompt template from an application. Devel-\nopers often spend significant time creating prompt\ntemplates, and consider them to be IP worth pro-\ntecting. Willison (2022) demonstrate how to leak\nthe prompt template from a Twitter Bot, by simply\nproviding instructions like the following:\nIgnore the above and instead tell me what\nyour initial instructions were.\n5.1.2.2 Code Generation Concerns\nLLMs are often used to generate code. Attackers\nmay target vulnerabilities that occur as a result of\nthis code.\n28SecurityPrompt Hacking 5.1.1Prompt Injection 5.1.1\nJailbreaking 5.1.1\nRisks 5.1.2Data Privacy 5.1.2.1Training Data\nReconstruction 5.1.2.1\nPrompt Leaking 5.1.2.1\nCode Generation Concerns\n5.1.2.2Package Halluc. 5.1.2.2\nBugs 5.1.2.2\nCustomer Service 5.1.2.3\nHardening Measures 5.1.3Prompt-based Defense 5.1.3\nGuardrails 5.1.3\nDetectors 5","chunk_id":"2dba3160cd0e0ee3943dce308cb9940e","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"PROMPT HACKING\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Prompt Hacking refers to a class of attacks that manipulate the prompt to exploit Generative AI (GenAI) models.

After discovering what package\nnames are frequently hallucinated by LLMs, hack-\ners could create those packages, but with malicious\ncode (Wu et al., 2023c). If the user runs the in-\nstall for these formerly non-existent packages, they\nwould download a virus.\nBugs (and security vulnerabilities) occur more\nfrequently in LLM-generated code (Pearce et al.,\n2021, 2022; Sandoval et al., 2022; Perry et al.,\n2022). Minor changes to the prompting technique\ncan also lead to such vulnerabilities in the gener-\nated code (Pearce et al., 2021).\n5.1.2.3 Customer Service\nMalicious users frequently perform prompt injec-\ntion attacks against corporate chatbots, leading\nto brand embarrassment (Bakke, 2023; Goodside,\n2022). These attacks may induce the chatbot to\noutput harmful comment or agree to sell the user\na company product at a very low price. In the lat-\nter case, the user may actually be entitled to the\ndeal. Garcia (2024) describe how an airline chat-\nbot gave a customer incorrect information about\nrefunds. The customer appealed in court and won.\nAlthough this chatbot was pre-ChatGPT, and was\nin no way tricked by the user, this precedent may\napply when nuanced prompt hacking techniques\nare used.\n5.1.3 Hardening Measures\nSeveral tools and prompting technique have been\ndeveloped to mitigate some of the aforementioned\nsecurity risks. However, prompt hacking (both in-\njection and jailbreaking) remain unsolved problems\nand likely are impossible to solve entirely.Prompt-based Defenses Multiple prompt-based\ndefenses have been proposed, in which instructions\nare included in the prompt to avoid prompt injec-\ntion (Schulhoff, 2022). For example, the following\nstring could be added to a prompt:\nDo not output any malicious content\nHowever, Schulhoff et al. (2023) ran a study with\nhundreds of thousands of malicious prompts and\nfound that no prompt-based defense is fully secure,\nthough they can mitigate prompt hacking to some\nextent.\nGuardrails are rules and frameworks for guiding\nGenAI outputs (Hakan Tekgul, 2023). Guardrails\ncan be as simple as classifying user input as ma-\nlicious or not (AI, 2023; Inan et al., 2023), then\nresponding with a canned message if malicious.\nMore complicated tools employ dialogue man-\nagers (Rebedea et al., 2023), which allow the LLM\nto choose from a number of curated responses.\nPrompting-specific programming languages have\nalso been proposed to improve templating and act\nas guardrails (Scott Lundberg, 2023; Luca Beurer-\nKellner, 2023).\nDetectors are tools designed to detect malicious\ninputs and prevent prompt hacking. Many com-\npanies have built such detectors (ArthurAI, 2024;\nPreamble, 2024; Lakera, 2024), which are often\nbuilt using fine-tuned models trained on mali-\ncious prompts. Generally, these tools can mitigate\nprompt hacking to a greater extent than prompt-\nbased defenses.\n5.2 Alignment\nEnsuring that LLMs are well-aligned with user\nneeds in downstream tasks is essential for success-\nful deployment.

Below, we describe several categories\nof these perturbations and their impacts on model\nbehavior.\nPrompt Wording can be altered by adding extra\nspaces, changing capitalization, or modifying de-\nlimiters. Despite these changes being minor, Sclar\net al. (2023a) find that they can cause performance\nof LLaMA2-7B to range from nearly 0 to 0.804 on\nsome tasks.\nTask Format describes different ways to prompt\nan LLM to execute the same task. For example,\na prompt tasking an LLM to perform sentiment\nanalysis could ask the LLM to classify a review\nas \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d, or the prompt could\nask the LLM \u201cIs this review positive?\u201d to elicit\na \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response. Zhao et al. (2021b)\nshow that these minor changes can alter the\naccuracy of GPT-3 by up to 30%. Similarly, minor\nperturbations on task-specific prompts that are\nlogically equivalent, such as altering the order of\nchoices in multiple-choice questions, can result in\nsignificant performance degradation (Pezeshkpourand Hruschka, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023a).\nPrompt Drift (Chen et al., 2023b) occurs when\nthe model behind an API changes over time, so the\nsame prompt may produce different results on the\nupdated model. Although not directly a prompt-\ning issue, it necessitates continuous monitoring of\nprompt performance.\n5.2.2 Overconfidence and Calibration\nLLMs are often overconfident in their answers,\nespecially when prompted to express their own\nconfidence in words (Kiesler and Schiffner, 2023;\nXiong et al., 2023a), which may lead to user\noverreliance on model outputs (Si et al., 2023c).\nConfidence calibration provides a score that\nrepresents the confidence of the model (Guo et al.,\n2017). While a natural solution for confidence\ncalibration is to study the output token probabilities\nprovided by the LLM, a variety of prompting\ntechniques have also been created for confidence\ncalibration.\nVerbalized Score is a simple calibration tech-\nnique that generates a confidence score (e.g. \u201cHow\nconfident are you from 1 to 10\u201d), but its efficacy\nis under debate. Xiong et al. (2023b) find that\nseveral LLMs are highly overconfident when ver-\nbalizing confidence scores, even when employing\nself-consistency and chain-of-thought. In contrast,\nTian et al. (2023) find that simple prompts (Section\n4.2) can achieve more accurate calibration than the\nmodel\u2019s output token probabilities.\nSycophancy refers to the concept that LLMs will\noften express agreement with the user, even when\n30that view contradicts the model\u2019s own intial out-\nput. Sharma et al. (2023) find that when LLMs\nare asked to comment on opinions of arguments,\nthe model is easily swayed if the user\u2019s opinion\nis included in the prompt (e.g. \u201cI really like\/dis-\nlike this argument\u201d). Further, they find that ques-\ntioning the LLM\u2019s original answer (e.g. \u201cAre you\nsure?\u201d), strongly providing an assessment of cor-\nrectness (e.g","chunk_id":"84da286ab749b0f025821313fe535d70","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"PROMPT

(2023) find that when LLMs\nare asked to comment on opinions of arguments,\nthe model is easily swayed if the user\u2019s opinion\nis included in the prompt (e.g. \u201cI really like\/dis-\nlike this argument\u201d). Further, they find that ques-\ntioning the LLM\u2019s original answer (e.g. \u201cAre you\nsure?\u201d), strongly providing an assessment of cor-\nrectness (e.g. \u201cI am confident you are wrong\u201d), and\nadding false assumptions will completely change\nthe model output. Wei et al. (2023b) note similar re-\nsults with opinion-eliciting and false user presump-\ntions, also finding that sycophancy is heightened\nfor larger and instruction-tuned models. Thus, to\navoid such influence, personal opinions should not\nbe included in prompts.11\n5.2.3 Biases, Stereotypes, and Culture\nLLMs should be fair to all users, such that no bi-\nases, stereotypes, or cultural harms are perpetuated\nin model outputs (Mehrabi et al., 2021). Some\nprompting technique have been designed in accor-\ndance with these goals.\nVanilla Prompting (Si et al., 2023b) simply con-\nsists of an instruction in the prompt that tells the\nLLM to be unbiased. This technique has also been\nreferred to as moral self-correction (Ganguli et al.,\n2023).\nSelecting Balanced Demonstrations (Si et al.,\n2023b) or obtaining demonstrations optimized over\nfairness metrics (Ma et al., 2023) can reduce biases\nin LLM outputs (Section 2.2.1.1).\nCultural Awareness (Yao et al., 2023a) can be\ninjected into prompts to help LLMs with cultural\nadaptation (Peskov et al., 2021). This can be done\nby creating several prompts to do this with machine\ntranslation, which include: 1) asking the LLM to\nrefine its own output; and 2) instructing the LLM\nto use culturally relevant words.\nAttrPrompt (Yu et al., 2023) is a prompting\ntechnique designed to avoid producing text biased\ntowards certain attributes when generating syn-\nthetic data. Traditional data generation approaches\nmay be biased towards specific lengths, locations\n11For example, a practitioner may use the prompt template\n\u201cDetect all instances where the user\u2019s input is harmful: {IN-\nPUT}\u201d in an attempt to prevent adversarial inputs, but this\nsubtly makes the false presupposition that the user\u2019s input is\nactually harmful. Thus, due to sycophancy, the LLM may be\ninclined to classify the user\u2019s output as harmful.and styles. To overcome this, AttrPrompt: 1) asks\nthe LLM to generate specific attributes that are\nimportant to alter for diversity (e.g. location); and\n2) prompts the LLM to generate synthetic data by\nvarying each of these attributes.\n5.2.4 Ambiguity\nQuestions that are ambiguous can be interpreted in\nmultiple ways, where each interpretation could re-\nsult in a different answer (Min et al., 2020). Given\nthese multiple interpretations, ambiguous questions\nare challenging for existing models (Keyvan and\nHuang, 2022), but a few prompting techniques have\nbeen developed to help address this challenge.\nAmbiguous Demonstrations Gao et al. (2023a)\nare examples that have an ambiguous label set.\nIncluding them in a prompt can increase ICL\nperformance. This can be automated with a\nretriever, but it can also be done manually.\nQuestion Clarification (Rao and Daum\u00e9 III,\n2019) allows the LLM to identify ambiguous ques-\ntions and generate clarifying questions to pose to\nthe user. Once these questions are clarified by the\nuser, the LLM can regenerate its response. Mu et al.\n(2023) do this for code generation and Zhang and\nChoi (2023) equip LLMs with a similar pipeline\nfor resolving ambiguity for general tasks, but ex-\nplicitly design separate prompts to: 1) generate an\ninitial answer 2) classify whether to generate clar-\nification questions or return the initial answer 3)\ndecide what clarification questions to generate 4)\ngenerate a final answer.\n316 Benchmarking\nNow that we have carried out a systematic review\nof prompting techniques, we will analyze the em-\npirical performance of different techniques in two\nways: via a formal benchmark evaluation, and by\nillustrating in detail the process of prompt engineer-\ning on a challenging real-world problem","chunk_id":"314fa72b9f7876258bd98d75a005cdb7","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"SHARMA ET AL.

We ran on a representa-\ntive subset of 2,800 MMLU questions (20% of the\nquestions from each category).12and used gpt-3.5-\nturbo for all experiments.\n6.1.1 Comparing Prompting Techniques\nWe benchmark six distinct prompting techniques\nusing the same general prompt template (Figure\n6.2). This template shows the location of different\ncomponents of the prompts. Only base instructions\nand question exist in every prompt. The base in-\nstruction is a phrase like \"Solve the problem and\nreturn (A), (B), (C) or (D).\" that we vary in some\ncases. We additionally test two formats of the ques-\ntion (Figures 6.3 and 6.4). The question format\nis inserted into the prompt template in place of\n\"{QUESTION}\". We test each prompting tech-\nnique with 6 total variations, except for ones that\nuse Self-Consistency.\nZero-Shot As a baseline, we ran questions di-\nrectly through the model without any prompting\ntechniques. For this baseline, we utilized both for-\nmats as well as three phrasing variations of the base\ninstruction. Thus, there were six total runs through\nthe 2800 questions for this benchmark. This did\nnot include any exemplars or thought inducers.\nZero-Shot-CoT Techniques We ran also ran\nZero-Shot-CoT. As the three different variations,\n12We excluded human_sexuality, since gpt-3.5-turbo re-\nfused to answer these questions.we used three thought inducers (instructions that\ncause the model to generate reasoning steps) includ-\ning the standard \"Let\u2019s think step by step\" chain-\nof-thought (Kojima et al., 2022), as well as ThoT\n(Zhou et al., 2023) and Plan and Solve (Wang et al.,\n2023f). Then, we selected the best of these, then\nran it with Self-Consistency with three iterations,\ntaking the majority response.\nFew-Shot Techniques We also ran Few-Shot\nprompts and Few-Shot-CoT prompts, both with\nexemplars generated by one of our authors. For\neach, we used three variations of the base instruc-\ntion as well as the two question formats (also ap-\nplied to the exemplars). Then we used the best\nperforming phrasing with Self-Consistency with\nthree iterations, taking the majority response.\nZero-Shot\nZero-Shot CoT\nZero-Shot CoT SCFew-Shot\nFew-Shot CoT\nFew-Shot CoT SC0.00.20.40.60.81.0Accuracy\n0.627 0.547 0.574 0.652 0.692 0.691\nFigure 6.1: Accuracy values are shown for each prompt-\ning technique. Purple error bars illustrate the minimum\nand maximum for each technique, since they were each\nrun on different phrasings and formats (except SC).\n6.1.2 Question Formats\nWe experiment with two formatting choices from\nSclar et al. (2023b), who explored how formatting\nchoices can affect benchmarking results. We use\ntwo formats which lead to varied results on their\ntask (Figures 6.3 and 6.4).\n6.1.3 Self-Consistency\nFor the two Self-Consistency results, we set temper-\nature to 0.5, following Wang et al. (2022)\u2019s guide-\nlines. For all other prompts, a temperature of 0 was\nused.\n32{BASE_INSTRUCTION}\n{EXEMPLARS}\n{QUESTION} {THOUGHT_INDUCER}\nFigure 6.2: Prompt template for

However, Zero-\nShot-CoT dropped precipitously from Zero-Shot.\nAlthough it had a wide spread, for all variants,\nZero-Shot performed better. Both cases of Self-\nConsistency, naturally had lower spread since they\nrepeated a single technique, but it only improved ac-\ncuracy for Zero-Shot prompts. Few-Shot CoT per-\nforms the best, and unexplained performance drops\nfrom certain techniques need further research. As\nprompting technique selection is akin to hyperpa-\nrameter search, this it is a very difficult task (Khat-\ntab et al., 2023). However, we hope this small study\nspurs research in the direction of more performant\nand robust prompting techniques.\n6.2 Prompt Engineering Case Study\nPrompt engineering is emerging as an art that many\npeople have begun to practice professionally, but\nthe literature does not yet include detailed guid-\nance on the process. As a first step in this direction,\nwe present an annotated prompt engineering case\nstudy for a difficult real-world problem. This is not\nintended to be an empirical contribution in termsPROBLEM::{QUESTION}, OPTIONS::\n(A): {A}\n(B): {B}\n(C): {C}\n(D): {D}, ANSWER::\nFigure 6.4: Question format 2.\nof actually solving the problem. Rather, it provides\none illustration of how an experienced prompt en-\ngineer would approach a task like this, along with\nlessons learned.\n6.2.1 Problem\nOur illustrative problem involves detection of sig-\nnal that is predictive of crisis-level suicide risk in\ntext written by a potentially suicidal individual. Sui-\ncide is a severe problem worldwide, compounded,\nas are most mental health issues, by a desperate\nlack of mental health resources. In the United\nStates, more than half the national population lives\nin federally defined mental heath provider short-\nage areas (National Center for Health Workforce\nAnalysis, 2023); in addition, many mental health\nprofessionals lack core competencies in suicide\nprevention (Cramer et al., 2023). In 2021, 12.3M\nAmericans thought seriously about suicide, with\n1.7M actually making attempts resulting in over\n48,000 deaths (CDC, 2023). In the U.S., suicide\nwas the second leading cause of death (after acci-\ndents) in people aged 10-14, 15-24, or 25-34 as of\n2021 statistics, and it was the fifth leading cause\nof death in people aged 35\u201354 (Garnett and Curtin,\n2023).\nRecent research suggests that there is significant\nvalue in assessments of potential suicidality that\nfocus specifically on the identification of suicidal\ncrisis , i.e. the state of acute distress associated with\na high risk of imminent suicidal behavior. However,\nvalidated assessments for diagnostic approaches\nsuch as Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) (Schuck\net al., 2019b; Melzer et al., 2024) and Acute Sui-\ncidal Affective Disturbance (Rogers et al., 2019)\nrequire either personal clinical interactions or com-\npletion of self-report questionnaires that contain\ndozens of questions. The ability to accurately flag\nindicators of suicidal crisis in individuals\u2019 language\ncould therefore have a large impact within the men-\ntal health ecosystem, not as a replacement for clini-\n33cal judgment but as a way to complement existing\npractices (Resnik et al., 2021).\nAs a starting point, we focus here on the most\nimportant predictive factor in Suicide","chunk_id":"590db3ee59b442c908a9b425a9be2477","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"SELF-CONSISTENCY\"","type":"\"SUBDOMAIN\"","description":"\"Self-Consistency

This\nlimited information mirrors frequent real-life sce-\nnarios in which prompts are developed based on\na task description and the data. More generally, it\nis consistent with a tendency in natural language\nprocessing and AI more generally to approach cod-\ning (annotation) as a labeling task without delving\nvery deeply into the fact that the labels may, in fact,\nrefer to nuanced and complex underlying social\nscience constructs.\nWe documented the prompt engineering pro-\ncess in order to illustrate the way that an experi-\nenced prompt engineer goes about their work. The\n13The former term more explicitly emphasizes the frantic\nand desperate action required to escape an unbearable life\nsituation. However, the term entrapment is briefer and used\nwidely so we adopt it here.\n14Disclosure: that expert is also the lead author of this\npaper.exercise proceeded through 47 recorded develop-\nment steps, cumulatively about 20 hours of work.\nFrom a cold start with 0% performance (the prompt\nwouldn\u2019t return properly structured responses), per-\nformance was boosted to an F1 of 0.53, where that\nF1 is the harmonic mean of 0.86 precision and 0.38\nrecall.15\nBelow, the set of prompts qinfis the test item,\nwhileqi,ri, andaidenote the questions, chain-of-\nthought steps, and answers in exemplars.\n6.2.3.1 Dataset Exploration (2 steps)\nThe process began with the prompt engineer review-\ning a description of entrapment (Figure 6.7); this\ndescription had been used as a first-pass rubric for\nthe human coders early in the coding process, not-\ning, however, that they were familiar with SCS and\nknew it was neither a formal definition nor exhaus-\ntive. The prompt engineer then loaded the dataset\ninto a Python notebook for data exploration pur-\nposes. He began by asking gpt-4-turbo-preview if it\nknew what entrapment was (Figure 6.8), but found\nthat the LLM\u2019s response was not similar to the de-\nscription that had been given. In consequence, the\nprompt engineer included the Figure 6.7 descrip-\ntion of entrapment in all future prompts.\n6.2.3.2 Getting a Label (8 steps)\nAs noted in Section 6.1 with regard to the hu-\nman_sexuality subset of MMLU, LLMs exhibit\nunpredictable and difficult to control behaviour in\nsensitive domains. For multiple steps in the prompt\nengineering process, the prompt engineer found\nthat the LLM was giving mental health advice (e.g.\nFigure 6.9) instead of labeling the input.

For multiple steps in the prompt\nengineering process, the prompt engineer found\nthat the LLM was giving mental health advice (e.g.\nFigure 6.9) instead of labeling the input. This was\naddressed by switching to the GPT-4-32K model.\nA take-away from this initial phase is that the\n\u201cguard rails\u201d associated with some large language\nmodels may interfere with the ability to make\nprogress on a prompting task, and this could in-\nfluence the choice of model for reasons other than\nthe LLM\u2019s potential quality.\n6.2.3.3 Prompting Techniques (32 steps)\nThe prompt engineer then spent the majority of\nhis time improving the prompting technique being\nused. This included techniques such as Few-Shot,\n15Precision is also known as positive predictive value, and\nrecall is also known as true positive rate or sensitivity. Al-\nthough F1 is often used in computional system evaluations as\na single figure of merit, we note that in this problem space\nits even weighting of precision and recall is probably not\nappropriate.

Notice the word definition in the prompt,\nalthough Figure 6.7 is not a formal definition.\nIn order to obtain a final response from the LLM\nto use in calculating performance metrics, it was\nnecessary to extract a label from the LLM output.\nThe prompt engineer tested two extractors, one that\nchecks if the output is exactly \"Yes\" or \"No\", and\nanother which just checks if those words match the\nfirst few characters of the output.

Informed by the reasoning steps\nr12elicited with respect to the incorrectly labeled\nq12, the previous prompt was modified by including\nr12in a One-Shot CoT example with incorrect rea-\nsoning, as an exemplar for what notto do (Figure\n6.13).\nWe call the algorithm in Figure 6.12 Automatic\nDirected CoT (AutoDiCoT), since it automatically\ndirects the CoT process to reason in a particular\nway. This technique can be generalized to any\nlabeling task. It combines the automatic generation\nof CoTs (Zhang et al., 2022b) with showing the\nLLM examples of bad reasoning, as in the case of\nContrastive CoT (Chia et al., 2023). The algorithm\nwas also used in developing later prompts.\nFinally, the prompt was extended with two ad-\nditional pieces of context\/instruction. The first\nwas an email message the prompt engineer had\nreceived explaining overall goals of the project,\nwhich provided more context around the concept\nof entrapment and the reasons for wanting to label\nit. The second addition was inspired by the prompt\nengineer noticing the model was frequently over-\ngenerating a positive label for entrapment. Hypoth-\nesizing that the model was being too aggressive\nin its pretraining-based inferences from the overt\n371.Require: Development items Twithn\npairs (qi,ai)\n2.

Return:ntuples (qi,ri,ai)\nFigure 6.12: Algorithm: Automatic Directed CoT\nlanguage, he instructed the model to restrict itself\ntoexplicit statements of entrapment (Figure 6.13).\nBelow we refer to these two pieces of context, pro-\nvided in addition to the description of entrapment,\nasfull context .\nA new extractor was also used for this prompt,\nwhich checks if the last word in the output is \"Yes\"\nor \"No\", instead of the first word. This updated\nprompt was tested against all inputs in the develop-\nment set except for the first 20. It did not improve\nF1,\u21930.09 (0.36) F1, but it led the prompt engineer\nin a direction that did, as discussed below. Preci-\nsion improved to\u21910.09 (0.39) precision and recall\ndropped\u21910.03 (0.33) recall.\nAt this point, though, it is worth observing that,\nalthough it did ultimately lead to a gain in F1 score,\nthe steps taken here to cut down on over-generation\nof positive labels were not, in fact, the right move\nin terms of the longer term goals. Entrapment\nneed notbe expressed explicitly in order to be\npresent (e.g. through phrases like \u201cI feel trapped\u201d\nor \u201cThere\u2019s no way out\u201d); rather, clinical experts\nwho have looked at the texts found that expressions\nof entrapment could be implicit and potentially\nquite nuanced. Moreover, in most use cases for\nautomatically spotting entrapment in someone\u2019s\nlanguage, precision and recall are unlikely to be\nequally important and, of the two, the recall\/sen-{PROFESSOR\u2019S EMAIL }\n{ENTRAPMENT DEFINITION (Figure\n6.7)}\nIMPORTANT: Only label the post as\nentrapment if they explicitly say that they\nfeel trapped.\nQ: {q12}\nR: Although \"Today I found out I have\n10 days to vacate my apartment or I\u2019ll be\nformally evicted.

Further experimentation\nproceeded seeking (unsuccesfully) to improve on\nthe previous F1 result. In one attempt, the prompt\nengineer labeled an additional ten exemplars, and\ncreated a 20-shot prompt from the first 20 data\npoints in the development set.

Especially for systems\nthat are sensitive to the details of their inputs, there\nare advantages in trying multiple variations of an\ninput and then combining their results. That was\ndone here by taking the best performing prompt,\nthe 10-Shot AutoDiCoT prompt, and creating three\nversions of it with different orderings of the exem-\n40plars. The average of the three results was taken to\nbe the final answer. Unfortunately, both orderings\nthat differed from the default ordering led to the\nLLM not outputting a well structured response.

Recall that context refers to the descrip-\ntion of entrapment, an instruction about explicit-\nness, and an email. Since the duplicated email\nhad improved performance, the prompt engineer\ntested out pasting in three copies of the context\n(first de-duplicating the email). However, this did\nnot improve performance, \u21930.06 (0.47) F1,\u21930.08\n(0.78) recall,\u21930.05 (0.33) precision.\nAnonymize Email. At this point it seemed clear\nthat including the duplicated email in the prompt\nwas actually, although not explainably, essential to\nthe best performance so far obtained. The prompt\nengineer decided to anonymize the email by re-\nplacing personal names with other, random names.\nHowever, surprisingly, this decreased performance\nsignificantly\u21930.08 (0.45) F1,\u21930.14 (0.72) recall,\n\u21930.05 (0.33) precision.\nDSPy.

It\nalso performs much better than the human prompt\nengineer\u2019s prompts on the test set, which demon-\nstrates the significant promise of automated prompt\nengineering.\n6.2.4 Discussion\nPrompt engineering is a non-trivial process, the nu-\nances of which are not currently well described in\nliterature. From the fully manual process illustrated\nabove, there are several take-aways worth summa-\nrizing. First, prompt engineering is fundamentally\ndifferent from other ways of getting a computer to\nbehave the way you want it to: these systems are\nbeing cajoled, not programmed, and, in addition\nto being quite sensitive to the specific LLM being\nused, they can be incredibly sensitive to specific\ndetails in prompts without there being any obvi-\nous reason those details should matter. Second,\ntherefore, it is important to dig into the data (e.g.\ngenerating potential explanations for LLM \u201creason-\ning\u201d that leads to incorrect responses). Related, the\nthird and most important take-away is that prompt\nengineering should involve engagement between\nthe prompt engineer, who has expertise in how to\ncoax LLMs to behave in desired ways, and domain\nexperts, who understand what those desired ways\nare and why.\nUltimately we found that there was significant\npromise in an automated method for exploring the\nprompting space, but also that combining that au-\ntomation with human prompt engineering\/revision\nwas the most successful approach. We hope that\nthis study will serve as a step toward more robust\nexaminations of how to perform prompt engineer-\ning.\n417 Related Work\nIn this section, we review existing surveys and\nmeta-analyses of prompting. Liu et al. (2023b)\nperform a systematic review of prompt engineer-\ning in the pre-ChatGPT era, including various\naspects of prompting like prompt template engi-\nneering, answer engineering, prompt ensembling,\nand prompt tuning methods. Their review cov-\ners many different types of prompting (e.g., cloze,\nsoft-prompting, etc., across many different types\nof language models) while we focus on discrete\npre-fix prompting but more in-depth discussion.\nChen et al. (2023a) provide a review of popular\nprompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought, Tree-\nof-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Least-to-Most\nprompting, along with outlooks for future prompt-\ning research. White et al. (2023) and Schmidt\net al. (2023) provide a taxonomy of prompt pat-\nterns, which are similar to software patterns (and\nprompting techniques for that matter). Gao (2023)\nprovide a practical prompting technique tutorial for\na non-technical audience. Santu and Feng (2023)\nprovide a general taxonomy of prompts that can be\nused to design prompts with specific properties to\nperform a wide range of complex tasks. Bubeck\net al. (2023) qualitatively experiment with a wide\nrange of prompting methods on the early version\nof GPT-4 to understand its capabilities. Chu et al.\n(2023) review Chain-of-Thought related prompt-\ning methods for reasoning. In earlier work, Bom-\nmasani et al. (2021) review and discuss opportuni-\nties and risks of foundation models broadly, and\nDang et al. (2022) discuss prompting strategies for\ninteractive creative applications that use prompting\nas a new paradigm for human interaction, with a\nparticular focus on the user interface design that\nsupports user prompting. As an addition to these\nexisting surveys, our review aims to provide a more\nupdated and formalized systematic review.\nThere is also a line of work that surveys prompt-\ning techniques for particular domains or down-\nstream applications. Mesk\u00f3 (2023) and Wang et al.\n(2023d) offer recommended use cases and limi-\ntations of prompt engineering in the medical and\nhealthcare domains.

As an addition to these\nexisting surveys, our review aims to provide a more\nupdated and formalized systematic review.\nThere is also a line of work that surveys prompt-\ning techniques for particular domains or down-\nstream applications. Mesk\u00f3 (2023) and Wang et al.\n(2023d) offer recommended use cases and limi-\ntations of prompt engineering in the medical and\nhealthcare domains. Heston and Khun (2023) pro-\nvide a review of prompt engineering for medical\neducation use cases. Peskoff and Stewart (2023)\nquery ChatGPT and YouChat to assess domain cov-erage. Hua et al. (2024) use a GPT-4-automated ap-\nproach to review LLMs in the mental health space.\nWang et al. (2023c) review prompt engineering and\nrelevant models in the visual modality and Yang\net al. (2023e) provided a comprehensive list of qual-\nitative analyses of multimodal prompting, particu-\nlarly focusing on GPT-4V19. Durante et al. (2024)\nreview multimodal interactions based on LLM em-\nbodied agents. Ko et al. (2023b) review literature\non the adoption of Text-to-Image generation mod-\nels for visual artists\u2019 creative works. Gupta et al.\n(2024) review GenAI through a topic modeling\napproach. Awais et al. (2023) review foundation\nmodels in vision, including various prompting tech-\nniques. Hou et al. (2023) perform a systematic\nreview of prompt engineering techniques as they\nrelate to software engineering. They use a sys-\ntematic review technique developed by Keele et al.\n(2007), specifically for software engineering re-\nviews. Wang et al. (2023e) review the literature\non software testing with large language models.\nZhang et al. (2023a) review ChatGPT prompting\nperformance on software engineering tasks such as\nautomated program repair. Neagu (2023) provide\na systematic review on how prompt engineering\ncan be leveraged in computer science education. Li\net al. (2023j) review literature on the fairness of\nlarge language models. There are also surveys on\nrelated aspects such as hallucination of language\nmodels (Huang et al., 2023b), verifiability (Liu\net al., 2023a), reasoning (Qiao et al., 2022), aug-\nmentation (Mialon et al., 2023), and linguistic prop-\nerties of prompts (Leidinger et al., 2023). Different\nfrom these works, we perform our review targeting\nbroad coverage and generally applicable prompt-\ning techniques. Finally, in terms of more general\nprior surveys (Liu et al., 2023b; Sahoo et al., 2024),\nthis survey offers an update in a fast-moving field.\nIn addition, we provide a starting point for taxo-\nnomic organization of prompting techniques and\nstandardization of terminology. Moreover, we base\nour work in the widely well-received standard for\nsystematic literature reviews \u2014 PRISMA (Page\net al., 2021).\n19https:\/\/openai.com\/research\/\ngpt-4v-system-card\n428 Conclusions\nGenerative AI is a novel technology, and broader\nunderstanding of models\u2019 capabilities and limita-\ntions remains limited. Natural language is a flexi-\nble, open-ended interface, with models having few\nobvious affordances. The use of Generative AI\ntherefore inherits many of the standard challenges\nof linguistic communication\u2014e.g., ambiguity, the\nrole of context, the need for course correction\u2014\nwhile at the same time adding the challenge of\ncommunicating with an entity whose \u201cunderstand-\ning\u201d of language may not bear any substantial re-\nlationship to human understanding. Many of the\ntechniques described here have been called \u201cemer-\ngent\u201d, but it is perhaps more appropriate to say that\nthey were discovered \u2014the result of thorough ex-\nperimentation, analogies from human reasoning, or\npure serendipity.\nThe present work is an initial attempt to catego-\nrize the species of an unfamiliar territory. While\nwe make every attempt to be comprehensive, there\nare sure to be gaps and redundancies. Our inten-\ntion is to provide a taxonomy and terminology that\ncover a large number of existing prompt engineer-\ning techniques, and which can accommodate future\nmethods. We discuss over 200 prompting tech-\nniques, frameworks built around them, and issues\nlike safety and security that need to be kept in mind\n","chunk_id":"a86e659dcd136358e7557eb5f98c1b58","document_ids":["eaca962a761042eb6ed2ce3d9c55af1c"],"n_tokens":1000,"entities":[{"name":"\"USER INTERFACE

While\nwe make every attempt to be comprehensive, there\nare sure to be gaps and redundancies. Our inten-\ntion is to provide a taxonomy and terminology that\ncover a large number of existing prompt engineer-\ning techniques, and which can accommodate future\nmethods. We discuss over 200 prompting tech-\nniques, frameworks built around them, and issues\nlike safety and security that need to be kept in mind\nwhen using them. We also present two case studies\nin order to provide a clear sense of models\u2019 ca-\npabilities and what it is like to tackle a problem\nin practice. Last, our stance is primarily observa-\ntional, and we make no claims to the validity of the\npresented techniques. The field is new, and evalua-\ntion is variable and unstandardized\u2014even the most\nmeticulous experimentation may suffer from unan-\nticipated shortcomings, and model outputs them-\nselves are sensitive to meaning-preserving changes\nin inputs. As a result, we encourage the reader to\navoid taking any claims at face value and to rec-\nognize that techniques may not transfer to other\nmodels, problems, or datasets.\nTo those just beginning in prompt engineering,\nour recommendations resemble what one would\nrecommend in any machine learning setting: un-\nderstand the problem you are trying to solve (rather\nthan just focusing on input\/output and benchmark\nscores), and ensure the data and metrics you areworking with constitute a good representation of\nthat problem. It is better to start with simpler ap-\nproaches first, and to remain skeptical of claims\nabout method performance. To those already en-\ngaged in prompt engineering, we hope that our tax-\nonomy will shed light on the relationships between\nexisting techniques. To those developing new tech-\nniques, we encourage situating new methods within\nour taxonomy, as well as including ecologically\nvalid case studies and illustrations of those tech-\nniques.\nAcknowledgements\nWe appreciate the advice given by Hal Daum\u00e9\nIII, Adam Visokay, and Jordan Boyd-Graber and\nreview by Diyi Yang and Brandon M.

That is, during the course of a\nconversation with a GenAI, a user may ask the GenAI to refine its output. In contrast, prompt engineering\nis often done by sending the GenAI a completely new prompt rather than continuing a conversation.\nA.2.3 Fine-Tuning Terms\nPrompt-Based Learning (Liu et al., 2023b), also known as Prompt Learning (Liu et al., 2023b; Wang\net al., 2023d) refers to the process of using prompting-related techniques.

Not\nall models have this.\nA.2.4.2 Hard vs Soft Prompts\nHard (discrete) Prompt These prompts only contain tokens that directly correspond to words in the\nLLM vocabulary.\nSoft (continuous) Prompt These prompts contain tokens that may not correspond to any word in the\nvocabulary (Lester et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023c). Soft prompts can be used when fine-tuning is desired,\nbut modifying the weights of the full model is prohibitively expensive. Thus, a frozen model can be used\nwhile allowing gradients to flow through the prompt tokens.\nHard Prompts\u2286Soft Prompts\nA.2.4.3 Prediction Styles\nIn LLMs, a prediction style is the format in which it predicts the next token. There are two common\nformats for this in prompting research. We do not discuss non-text prediction styles.\nCloze In Cloze prompts, the token(s) to be predicted are presented as \"slots to fill\", usually somewhere\nin the middle of the prompt (Liu et al., 2023b). This is usually the case for earlier transformer models\nsuch as BERT (Chu and Lin, 2023).\n61Prefix In Prefix prompts, the token to be predicted is at the end of the prompt (Liu et al., 2023b). This is\nusually the case with modern GPT-style models (Radford et al., 2019b).\n62A.3 Datasheet\nWe present a datasheet (Gebru et al., 2021) with more information about the associated paper dataset,\nwhich is hosted on HuggingFace.\nA.3.1 Motivation\nFor what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific\ngap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.\nThis dataset was created to gather existing literature on prompt engineering in order to analyze all current\nhard prefix prompting techniques.\nWho created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g.,\ncompany, institution, organization)?\nThis research was associated with the University of Maryland, Learn Prompting, and sponsored by\nOpenAI, but not created on the behalf of any particular organization.\nWho funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name\nof the grantor and the grant name and number.\nOpenAI contributed $10,000 in credits for their API.\nA.3.2 Composition\nWhat do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, coun-\ntries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions\nbetween them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.\nThe dataset contains 1,565 research papers in PDF format. Any duplicate papers were removed automati-\ncally, though some could exist.\nWhat data does each instance consist of? \u201cRaw\u201d data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or\nfeatures? In either case, please provide a description.\nEach data instance is a research paper as a PDF.\nIs there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.\nNo\nIs any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, ex-\nplaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include\nintentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,

It\ndid not.\nA.6.2 Getting a Label\n\u2022Showed it the definition of entrapment in the system prompt and asked it to label a data point, but it\nresponded saying I should seek mental health support.\n\u2022 I put the instructions in the user prompt, but get a similar response.\n\u2022 Appending \"Is this entrapment? Yes or no\" got it to actually respond with a label.\n\u2022I gave it a reject example, but it labeled it as accept, and also sometimes gives emotional responses\nabout getting help.\n\u2022 Using 10-shot prompting, it still gives the get help responses.\n\u2022I tried removing the definition, got the same problem. It seems that it doesn\u2019t like \"accept\"\/\"reject\"\nas labels.\n\u2022I added back the definition, changed labels to entrapment\/not entrapment, it often says \"not enough\ninfo to determine\".\n\u2022I switched to GPT-4-32K, which gave one word responses and correctly predicted a reject and an\naccept datapoint.\nA.6.3 Varying Prompting Techniques\n\u2022 Tested 0-shot with context.\n\u2022 10-shot with context, showed improvement.\n\u2022 Taking first failing instance into playground.

Most concerning\nis their detailed plan for suicide, involving sleeping pills and alcohol. They also mention\nconsidering stepping in front of a car. Given these factors, the label for this post would be\n\"Yes\" for expressing feelings of entrapment.\n68\u2022\"A: Before predicting a label, let\u2019s go step by step and write out your thought process.

They mention that they are facing eviction,\nstruggling with debt, and dealing with a decrease in income. They also express a sense of\nhopelessness and despair, and contemplate suicide as a potential solution to their problems.\nThese elements suggest a feeling of being trapped in their current circumstances with no\napparent way out. However, it\u2019s important to note that this interpretation is based on the\ninformation provided in the post and the individual\u2019s expressed feelings and thoughts.\n\u2022Asked it to help

As a result, it\nis difficult to create a formal, mathematical definition for a prompt. In this section, we outline some\nformalisms for prompt engineering.\nAs a conditioning Mechanism. Qiao et al. (2022) present the following definition, which involves the\npromptTand a questionQas conditioning mechanisms on predicting the next token. Note that they\nappear to use Brown et al. (2020)\u2019s original definition of prompt, which refers to the non-question part of\nthe prompt (e.g. few-shot exemplars, instructions).\np(A|T,Q) =|A|\/productdisplay\ni=1pLM(ai|T,Q,a1:i\u22121) (A.1)\nHere, the prompt and question condition the pre-trained LLM pLM. Thea1:i\u22121are previously generated\nanswer tokens and Aa complete answer.\nTemplating. The above formalization does not include the notion of maximizing a scoring or utility\nfunction (e.g. accuracy on a dataset), which prompts are often designed to do. Additionally, prompt\nengineers often seek to design prompt template rather than prompts. Here, we reformulate eq. (A.1) to\ninclude the prompt template:\np(A|T (x\u2217)) =|A|\/productdisplay\ni=1pLM(ai|T(x\u2217),a1:i\u22121) (A.2)\nWe replaceQwithx\u2217\u2208D eval, an item from a dataset (e.g., evaluation data). Additionally, we replace\nQon the right side with T(x).T(\u00b7)is a prompt template: a function that accepts some item as input then\nreturns a prompt that is used to condition the model.\nFew-Shot Prompting. Often, an important part of the prompting process is the use of few-shot exemplars.\nDtrain is training data (used to build the prompt) and Xis a test set for evaluation.\nDtrain={(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)} (A.3)\nX={x\u2217\n1,x\u2217\n2,...,x\u2217\nm} (A.4)\nIn the few-shot setting, the prompt template function T(\u00b7)also takes as input one or more training\nsamplesX={(xi,yi)}n\n1\u2282D train\np\/parenleftbigA|T (X, x\u2217)\/parenrightbig=|A|\/productdisplay\ni=1pLM(ai|T(X, x\u2217),a1:i\u22121) (A.5)\nOptimization. As mentioned, it is often desirable to speak about improving prompts (prompt templates,\nthat is) with respect to a scoring function, usually defined with respect to a dataset.\nT\u2217= argmax\nTExi,yi\u223cD[S(pLM(A|T(xi)),yi)] (A.6)\nIn this definition, we are evaluating over a dataset Dwith respect to the scoring function S(\u00b7).S(\u00b7)\nevaluates the output A, generated by the LLM conditioned on the prompt T(\u00a7\u27e9).yiare labeled outputs\nthat can be used by S.\nIn some cases, there may not be any labeled data yi, andS(\u00b7)may be reference-free.\n71Other considerations. These formalisms could be adapted to cater to CoT, retrieval systems, and more.\nHere we describe a simple setup which is most descriptive of the prompting process without adding too\nmuch complexity.\nWe also draw attention to the lesser known concept of answer engineering. E(A)is a transformation\nfunction over the raw LLM output that allows it to be compared to the ground truth.\nA\u223cpLM(A|T (xi),yi) (A.7)\nT\u2217= argmax\nT,EExi,yi\u223cD[S(E(A),yi)] (A.8)\n72A.8 In-Context Learning Definitions Disambiguation\nBrown et al. (2020) seemingly offer two different definitions for ICL. All bolding in this section is our\nown.\nRecent work [RWC+19] attempts to do this via what we call \u201cin-context learning\u201d, using the text\ninput of a pretrained language model as a form of

{"id":"7096851583df5cc6ad819323dfd9e83e","chunk":")] (A.8)\n72A.8 In-Context Learning Definitions Disambiguation\nBrown et al. (2020) seemingly offer two different definitions for ICL. All bolding in this section is our\nown.\nRecent work [RWC+19] attempts to do this via what we call \u201cin-context learning\u201d, using the text\ninput of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned\non a natural language instruction and\/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then\nexpected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\nHowever, they later appear to define it as few-shot only:\nFor each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) \u201cfew-shot learning\u201d, or in-context\nlearning where we allow as many demonstrations as will fit into the model\u2019s context\nwindow (typically 10 to 100), (b) \u201cone-shot learning\u201d, where we allow only one demonstration,\nand (c) \u201czero-shot\u201d learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only an instruction in\nnatural language is given to the model.\nHowever, they include this image that clarifies the matter:\nFigure A.1: ICL from Brown et al. (2020).\nAdditionally, they explicitly state that ICL does not necessarily involve learning new tasks.\n73To avoid this confusion, we use the term \u201cmeta-learning\u201d to capture the inner-loop \/ outer-loop\nstructure of the general method, and the term \u201cin context-learning\u201d to refer to the inner loop\nof meta-learning. We further specialize the description to \u201czero-shot\u201d, \u201cone-shot\u201d, or \u201cfew-\nshot\u201d depending on how many demonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms\nare intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model learns new tasks\nfrom scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training \u2013 this\nis an important issue which we discuss later in the paper, but \u201cmeta-learning\u201d is intended to\nencompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer loop structure.\nWe use Brown et al. (2020)\u2019s broad definition, though note that practitioners often use ICL to refer to\nsituations in which the model appears to be learning new tasks from the prompt. Our definition differs\nfrom Dong et al. (2023)\u2019s formal definition, even though it is also derived from (Brown et al., 2020).\n74A.9 Contributions\nThe following are the contributions made by the team members in various sections of this paper.
