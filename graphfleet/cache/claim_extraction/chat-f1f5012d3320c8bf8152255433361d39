Therefore, no claims can be extracted based on the given claim description.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast\ndataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset. Table 3 shows the\nnumber of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.\nGlobal approaches vs. na ¨ıve RAG . As shown in Figure 4, global approaches consistently out-\nperformed the na ¨ıve RAG ( SS) approach in both comprehensiveness and diversity metrics across\ndatasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 72-83%\nfor Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82%\nand 62-71% respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test also achieved the expected results,\ni.e., that na ¨ıve RAG produces the most direct responses across all comparisons.\n9Podcast Transcripts News Articles\nC0 C1 C2 C3 TS C0 C1 C2 C3 TS\nUnits 34 367 969 1310 1669 55 555 1797 2142 3197\nTokens 26657 225756 565720 746100 1014611 39770 352641 980898 1140266 1707694\n% Max 2.6 22.2 55.8 73.5 100 2.3 20.7 57.4 66.8 100\nTable 3: Number of context units (community summaries for C0-C3 and text chunks for TS), corre-\nsponding token counts, and percentage of the maximum token count.
