Generative AI in Real -World \nWorkplaces: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity \nResearch. Microsoft.  \n1 INTRODUCTION  \nThere is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people’s \nproductivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, \nMicrosoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et \nal. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI \nand productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing \nliterature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. \nAlthough there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a \nbroad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to \nintroduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang \n2023; Dell’Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. \n2023). \n \nHowever, much of this existing literature on AI and productivity is \nlimited in that it consists primarily of lab-based studies. In these \nstudies, participants use d generative AI tools to complete \nresearcher -designed tasks in a controlled, simulated work \nenvironment , largely with a focus on tasks that the researchers \nhypothesized would be amenable to generative AI. Now that a \nmuch larger population of workers has access to generative AI \ntools, we can begin to understand the impact of these tools outside \nof a lab setting, as people perform their everyday jobs. This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(MICROSOFT<|>NONE<|>AI IMPACT<|>TRUE<|>2023-12-01T00:00:00<|>2023-12-01T00:00:00<|>Microsoft released a first AI and Productivity Report in December 2023, synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI and productivity, indicating a substantial step-function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers.<|>To help meet this interest, in December 2023, Microsoft released a first AI and Productivity Report (Cambon et al. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI and productivity.
