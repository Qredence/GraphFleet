Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect .\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(ELEANOR DILLON<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Eleanor Dillon participated in the Early Access Program Telemetry Study, which involved working with over 60 organizations and over 6000 individual employees across various industries and occupations.<|>Early Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia Jaffe, Sida Peng, and Alexia Cambon))\n##\n(SONIA JAFFE<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Sonia Jaffe participated in the Early Access Program Telemetry Study, which involved working with over 60 organizations and over 6000 individual employees across various industries and occupations.<|>Early Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia Jaffe, Sida Peng, and Alexia Cambon))\n##\n(SIDA PENG<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Sida Peng participated in the Early Access Program Telemetry Study, which involved working with over 60 organizations and over 6000 individual employees across various industries and occupations.<|>Early Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia Jaffe, Sida Peng, and Alexia Cambon))\n##\n(ALEXIA CAMBON<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Alexia Cambon participated in the Early Access Program Telemetry Study, which involved working with over 60 organizations and over 6000 individual employees across various industries and occupations.<|>Early Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia Jaffe, Sida Peng, and Alexia Cambon))\n##\n(MICROSOFT<|>NONE<|>PRODUCTIVITY IMPACT STUDY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Microsoft conducted a large-scale randomized controlled field experiment of Copilot for Microsoft 365, involving over 60 organizations and over 6000 individual employees.
