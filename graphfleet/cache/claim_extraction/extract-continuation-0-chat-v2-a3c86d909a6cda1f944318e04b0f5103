While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are known, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in a reference-free style (Wang et al., 2023a) as well as in head-to-head comparison of competing outputs (LLM-as-a-judge, Zheng et al., 2024). LLMs have also shown promise at evaluating the performance of conventional RAG systems, automatically evaluating qualities like context relevance, faithfulness, and answer relevance (RAGAS, Es et al., 2023). Given the multi-stage nature of our Graph RAG mechanism, the multiple conditions we wanted to compare, and the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we decided to adopt a head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator. We selected three target metrics capturing qualities that are desirable for sensemaking activities, as well as a control metric (directness) used as a indicator of validity. Since directness is effectively in opposition to comprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four metrics. Our head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\n•Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and details of the question?\n•Diversity . How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights on the question?\n•Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed judgements about the topic?\n•Directness . How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and asked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner if one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible. To account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.

The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized.
