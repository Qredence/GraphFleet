Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects of the graph index (including\nthe generic community summaries and the use of other graph-related RAG approaches).\nFuture work . The graph index, rich text annotations, and hierarchical community structure support-\ning the current Graph RAG approach offer many possibilities for refinement and adaptation. This\nincludes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of\nuser queries and graph annotations, as well as the possibility of hybrid RAG schemes that combine\nembedding-based matching against community reports before employing our map-reduce summa-\nrization mechanisms. This “roll-up” operation could also be extended across more levels of the\ncommunity hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory “drill down” mechanism that\nfollows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to support human\nsensemaking over entire text corpora. Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a\nna¨ıve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable\ncomparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For\nsituations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi-\nties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na ¨ıve RAG and\nachieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is\nforthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\n11Acknowledgements\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are no named entities that match the predefined entity specification ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event'] in the provided text.
