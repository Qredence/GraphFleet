Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2.

The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.
