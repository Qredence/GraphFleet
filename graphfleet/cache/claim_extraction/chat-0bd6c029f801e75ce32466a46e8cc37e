Therefore, no claims can be extracted.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are\nknown, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in a reference-\nfree style (Wang et al., 2023a) as well as in head-to-head comparison of competing outputs (LLM-\nas-a-judge, Zheng et al., 2024). LLMs have also shown promise at evaluating the performance of\nconventional RAG systems, automatically evaluating qualities like context relevance, faithfulness,\nand answer relevance (RAGAS, Es et al., 2023).\nGiven the multi-stage nature of our Graph RAG mechanism, the multiple conditions we wanted to\ncompare, and the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we\ndecided to adopt a head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator. We selected three\ntarget metrics capturing qualities that are desirable for sensemaking activities, as well as a control\nmetric (directness) used as a indicator of validity. Since directness is effectively in opposition to\ncomprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four metrics.\nOur head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\n•Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and\ndetails of the question?\n•Diversity . How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights\non the question?\n•Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed\njudgements about the topic?\n•Directness . How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and\nasked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner\nif one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible.\nTo account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.\nTable 2 shows an example of LLM-generated assessment.\n7Question Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\nGraph\nRAGOverview of Prominent Public Figures in Entertainment\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompass\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
