Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We discussed some initial findings on \ndifferences in generative AI usage and effects by an individual’s \nrole or function . These findings raise interesting  questions in terms \nof how different roles and functions  will find value from generative \nAI, in terms of efficiencies and also innovation gains . There is an \nopportunity to further study which individuals and business \nprocesses benefit most from AI, and how organiz ational leaders can \nenable and encourage AI’s productive use. There are also likely \nmany additional sources of heterogeneity, including, for instance , \nindividuals’ personalities  or the general conditions of the business , \ne.g. as in Otis et al. (2024). \n \nAssuming generative AI follows the path of most general purpose \ntechnologies (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) , workflows will , \nlooking forward,  be substantially redesigned to better integrate  AI. \nFurthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools \nthat make use of it are improving rapidly . This means not only that \nthe long-term effects of AI on productivity  will differ from those \nobserved in the short -term, but that we are likely to  continue to see \ndifferences between  local task effects and mo re global productivity \neffects. Research should try to capture and inform change s in \nworkflows , task design , and business processes  in addition to \nproductivity effects for fixed tasks.   \n \nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is \nthe common disconnect between the time savings people report \nfrom Copilot use and the actual time savings measure d. This has \nbeen observed not only across studies, where survey measures \nabout time saved tend to be larger than telemetry -based measures, \nbut also within a given study where researchers collect both survey \nand telemetry measures of time saved on a specific  task. There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n‘answer’ with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (N\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Extract Named Entities:**\n   - **Organizations:** Otis\n   - **Persons:** Brynjolfsson, McAfee\n   - **Geographical Locations:** None identified\n   - **Events:** None identified\n\n2. **Extract Claims:**\n   - **Claim 1:**\n     - **Subject:** OTIS\n     - **Object:** NONE\n     - **Claim Type:** PRODUCTIVITY IMPACT\n     - **Claim Status:** SUSPECTED\n     - **Claim Description:** Otis et al.
