{"result": "There are no claims or facts relevant to information discovery in the provided text. The text primarily discusses various advanced techniques and systems related to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs), without making any specific claims against entities.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Queries are then embedded into the same vector space, with the text\nchunks of the nearest kvectors used as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM’s context window.\nAdvanced RAG systems include pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval strategies designed to over-\ncome the drawbacks of Na ¨ıve RAG, while Modular RAG systems include patterns for iterative and\ndynamic cycles of interleaved retrieval and generation (Gao et al., 2023). Our implementation of\nGraph RAG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears resemblance to further\napproaches, such as generating a hierarchical index of text chunks by clustering the vectors of text\nembeddings (RAPTOR, Sarthi et al., 2024) or generating a “tree of clarifications” to answer mul-\ntiple interpretations of ambiguous questions (Kim et al., 2023). However, none of these iterative or\nhierarchical approaches use the kind of self-generated graph index that enables Graph RAG.\n104.2 Graphs and LLMs\nUse of graphs in connection with LLMs and RAG is a developing research area, with multiple\ndirections already established. These include using LLMs for knowledge graph creation (Tra-\njanoska et al., 2023) and completion (Yao et al., 2023), as well as for the extraction of causal\ngraphs (Ban et\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
