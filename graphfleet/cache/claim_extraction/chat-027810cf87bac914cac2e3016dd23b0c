Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,\nMicrosoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669\n×600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1 million tokens).\n•News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September\n2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,\ntechnology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 ×\n600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1.7 million tokens).\n3.2 Queries\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\nthe associated question sets target explicit fact retrieval rather than summarization for the purpose\nof data sensemaking, i.e., the process though which people inspect, engage with, and contextualize\ndata within the broader scope of real-world activities (Koesten et al., 2021). Similarly, methods for\nextracting latent summarization queries from source texts also exist (Xu and Lapata, 2021), but such\nextracted questions can target details that betray prior knowledge of the texts.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for more global sensemaking tasks, we need questions\nthat convey only a high-level understanding of dataset contents, and not the details of specific texts.\nWe used an activity-centered approach to automate the generation of such questions: given a short\ndescription of a dataset, we asked the LLM to identify Npotential users and Ntasks per user,\nthen for each (user, task) combination, we asked the LLM to generate Nquestions that require\nunderstanding of the entire corpus. For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n63.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
