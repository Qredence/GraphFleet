Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
