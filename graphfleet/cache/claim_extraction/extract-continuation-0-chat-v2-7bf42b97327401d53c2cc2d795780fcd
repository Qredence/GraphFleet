Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Conditions C1-C3 also showed slight improvements in answer\ncomprehensiveness and diversity over TS (global text summarization without a graph index).\n3.5 Configuration\nThe effect of context window size on any particular task is unclear, especially for models like\ngpt-4-turbo with a large context size of 128k tokens. Given the potential for information to\nbe “lost in the middle” of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to ex-\nplore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and\nmetrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
