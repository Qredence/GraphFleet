{"result": "There are no specific claims or facts relevant to information discovery in the provided text. The text primarily discusses the methodology and process of using a language model for entity extraction and summarization. Therefore, no entities or claims matching the given specifications were identified.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

We also support\na secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the\nextracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt aims to extract claims linked to detected\nentities, including the subject, object, type, description, source text span, and start and end dates.\nTo balance the needs of efficiency and quality, we use multiple rounds of “gleanings”, up to a\nspecified maximum, to encourage the LLM to detect any additional entities it may have missed\non prior extraction rounds. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess\nwhether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM\nresponds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that “MANY entities were missed\nin the last extraction” encourages the LLM to glean these missing entities. This approach allows us\nto use larger chunk sizes without a drop in quality (Figure 2) or the forced introduction of noise.\n2.3 Element Instances →Element Summaries\nThe use of an LLM to “extract” descriptions of entities, relationships, and claims represented in\nsource texts is already a form of abstractive summarization, relying on the LLM to create inde-\npendently meaningful summaries of concepts that may be implied but not stated by the text itself\n(e.g., the presence of implied relationships). To convert all such instance-level summaries into sin-\ngle blocks of descriptive text for each graph element (i.e., entity node, relationship edge, and claim\ncovariate) requires a further round of LLM summarization over matching groups of instances.\nA potential concern at this stage is that the LLM may not consistently extract references to the\nsame entity in the same text format, resulting in duplicate entity elements and thus duplicate nodes\nin the entity graph. However, since all closely-related “communities” of entities will be detected\nand summarized in the following step, and given that LLMs can understand the common entity\nbehind multiple name variations, our overall approach is resilient to such variations provided there\nis sufficient connectivity from all variations to a shared set of closely-related entities.\nOverall, our use of rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure\nis aligned with both the capabilities of LLMs and\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
