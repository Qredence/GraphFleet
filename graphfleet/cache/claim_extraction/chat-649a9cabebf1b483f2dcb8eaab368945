Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In a \nreview paper (published at the recent ACM SIGCHI 2024 \nconference) drawing on research in psychology, cognitive science, \nand the first wave of generative AI lab studies, researcher s explored \nhow generative AI (not Copilot specifically) changes the \nmetacognitive demands of a task. For example, prompt \nengineering, prompt iteration, and output evaluation all require \nmetacognitive effort that may not be needed when doing a task \nwithout assistance. This includes work such as developing explicit \nawareness of task goals, task decomposition, and gaining well -\nadjusted confidence in one’s ability to evaluate the output. \nMoreover, the availability of generative AI tools creates a more \ngeneral b urden of deciding how to apply these tools to tasks and \nworkflows. To do so “users must have self -awareness of the \napplicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their \nworkflow; well -adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a \ntask manually ver sus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in \nadapting workflows to GenAI.”  \n \nThe researchers suggest that the metacognitive demands of \ngenerative AI can be addressed both by improving users’ \nmetacognitive abilities and by reducing the metacognitive demands \nof the tools. Tools could improve metacognitive ability around task \ndecompos ition, for example, by responding to a prompt with a list \nof common subtasks and soliciting (optional) input from the user \nfor each subtask.  \n \nThe metacognitive demands of AI tools can be further reduced by \nimproving explainability, which can help users calibrate their \nconfidence in outputs and prompting techniques, and self -\nevaluation or co -auditing. Customizability can either increase or \ndecrease metacognitive demands depending on the context; \ncustomizability may make the tool more fitted to the user’s task and \nability, reducing the metacognitive work of prompting and \nevaluating, but making customization decisions can also add to \ncognitive load.  As usage spreads and the tools develop, the authors \nargue that research is needed to understand how tools affect \ndifferent users’ metacognitive processes and what design decisions \ncan lighten the load.  \nImpact of Copilot on Cognitive Load (Madeline Kleiner, Max \nMeijer, Katie Rotella, and Nora Presson\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
