Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In recent\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al., 2023) series,\nall of which can use in-context learning to summarize any content provided in their context window.\nThe challenge remains, however, for query-focused abstractive summarization over an entire corpus.\nSuch volumes of text can greatly exceed the limits of LLM context windows, and the expansion of\nsuch windows may not be enough given that information can be “lost in the middle” of longer\ncontexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In addition, although the direct retrieval of text\nchunks in na ¨ıve RAG is likely inadequate for QFS tasks, it is possible that an alternative form of\npre-indexing could support a new RAG approach specifically targeting global summarization.\nIn this paper, we present a Graph RAG approach based on global summarization of an LLM-derived\nknowledge graph (Figure 1). In contrast with related work that exploits the structured retrieval\nand traversal affordances of graph indexes (subsection 4.2\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No relevant claims were identified in the provided text based on the given entity specification and claim description.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
