Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI’s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people’s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI’s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature.  \n \nWhen we look at AI’s use in  the context of real\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CAMBON ET AL. 2023<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>2023-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-12-31T00:00:00<|>The first AI and Productivity report published by Cambon et al. in 2023 focused on tasks for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would perform well.<|>This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies presented in the first AI and Productivity report we published (Cambon et al. 2023).)\n##\n(MEYER ET AL. 2017<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>2017-01-01T00:00:00<|>2017-12-31T00:00:00<|>The research publication by Meyer et al. in 2017 discussed the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot.<|>Software developer workflows, for example, involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017).)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
