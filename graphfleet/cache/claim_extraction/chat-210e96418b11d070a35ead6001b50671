Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

In the following step, each of these chunks\nwill be passed to a set of LLM prompts designed to extract the various elements of a graph index.\nLonger text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction, but suffer from the recall degrada-\ntion of longer LLM context windows (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). This behavior can be\nobserved in Figure 2 in the case of a single extraction round (i.e., with zero gleanings): on a sample\ndataset (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), using a chunk size of 600 token extracted almost twice as\nmany entity references as when using a chunk size of 2400. While more references are generally\nbetter, any extraction process needs to balance recall and precision for the target activity.\n2.2 Text Chunks →Element Instances\nThe baseline requirement for this step is to identify and extract instances of graph nodes and edges\nfrom each chunk of source text. We do this using a multipart LLM prompt that first identifies all\nentities in the text, including their name, type, and description, before identifying all relationships\nbetween clearly-related entities, including the source and target entities and a description of their\nrelationship. Both kinds of element instance are output in a single list of delimited tuples.\nThe primary opportunity to tailor this prompt to the domain of the document corpus lies in the\nchoice of few-shot examples provided to the LLM for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020).\n3For example, while our default prompt extracting the broad class of “named entities” like people,\nplaces, and organizations is generally applicable, domains with specialized knowledge (e.g., science,\nmedicine, law) will benefit from few-shot examples specialized to those domains. We also support\na secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the\nextracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
