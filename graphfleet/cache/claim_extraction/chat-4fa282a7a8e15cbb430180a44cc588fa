The study involved 40 Microsoft employees who created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel spreadsheet. Half of the participants had access to Copilot and half did not. The study measured time, accuracy, and participants' perceived mental demand, stress, and how rushed the task felt. Participants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally demanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 out of 100).

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for the study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel spreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the participants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to measuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the study administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants’ cognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). Participants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally demanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 out of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty were similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 100) for how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t-test with p<.05. Interestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the average Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task feel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants’ ability to do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there may have been a small effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the statistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the effects observed by the participants in the survey.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants’ \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score.
