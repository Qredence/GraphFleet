Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as “maintenance solutions” than for those categorized \nas “new code development ,” which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a “paradox of reuse” dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem.
