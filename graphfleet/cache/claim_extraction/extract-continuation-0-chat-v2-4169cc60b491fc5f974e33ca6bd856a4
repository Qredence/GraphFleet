Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work . Further, they begin to reveal  some nuances in how \nAI is used , highlighting the importance of contextual factors such \nas skill or task selection on AI’s impact and providing early \nevidence that the presence of AI may impact people’s behavior  and \nthe larger ecosystem . \n \nBrynjolfsson et al . (2023) introduced  one of the earliest studies of \ngenerative AI in real-world work environments. They stud ied an \nAI-based conversational assistant for customer service agents in a \ncall center , and found that agents with the assistant resolved 14% \nmore issues per hour than those without the assistant. Consistent \nwith what has been observed in some lab studies (e.g., Noy and \nZhang 2023), t he largest impact was on novice and low -skilled \nworkers, with very little effect on experience d or highly -skilled \nworkers. \n \nHowever, observing larger benefits for less-skilled workers is \ncertainly not universal . Otis et al. ( 2024) examined the effects of a \ngenerative AI -powered entrepreneurship support tool  on Kenyan \nentrepreneurs’ business performance via an index measure based \non profit and revenue . They found that entrepreneurs with above -\nmedian performance prior to the start of the experiment saw gains \nof 0.19 standard deviations in performance when using the AI tool, \nwhile entrepreneurs with below -median performance  saw a \ndecrease of 0.09 standard deviations. Though the two groups used \nthe tool similar amounts, they tended to ask different types of \nquestions. This finding  emphasizes  the importance of contextual \nfactors in the productivity gains seen by using generative AI, a key \nobservation of this report as well.  \n \nIn addition , some early real -world studies show that the presence \nof AI may have cascading effects , not just affecting productivity on \na given task, but also changing which tasks people choose to do.  \nFor example, Wiles and Horton (202 4) explored how having an \nLLM generat e a first draft of a job posting affected postings and \nhiring on a large online labor market.
