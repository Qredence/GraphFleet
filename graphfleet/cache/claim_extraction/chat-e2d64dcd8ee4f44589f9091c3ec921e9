Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n‘answer’ with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI’s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI’s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in new ways that produce \neven larger productivity gains\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
