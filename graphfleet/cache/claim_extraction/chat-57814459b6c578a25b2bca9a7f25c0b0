Half worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar components and concepts, and the other half worked on a different task that involved modifying existing code using unfamiliar components and concepts. For each task, half of the participants completed the task using Copilot and the other half did not use it. All participants were allowed to use any online resources they wanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10-minute overview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with these small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence that the type of task matters for the impact that Copilot has on the developer. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time-savings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast, no substantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-Copilot groups for the less familiar task.)\n##\n(BEN HANRAHAN<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH STUDY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Ben Hanrahan co-authored a study investigating the conditions under which a developer might expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Given AI ’s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we ’re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot.
