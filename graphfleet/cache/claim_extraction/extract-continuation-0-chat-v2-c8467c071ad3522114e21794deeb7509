Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Participants were  recruited \nthrough a staffing agency that provides security services to large \ncompanies , allowing t his new lab study to focus on people who \ncurrently use security tools as part of their day -to-day jobs. \n \nOf the 147 security professional participants, three -quarters had 5 \nor more years of experience as a security analyst. Participants \nlogged into an instance of Microsoft’s security service platform, \nMicrosoft Defender, that was created for this experiment. There \nthey performed various tasks, including writing a summary of the \nincident and answering multiple -choice questions about it. Those \nwith Copilot were 7% more accurate on the multiple -choice \nquestions (p<.05). Researchers also asked experts for a list o f key \nfacts that should have been included in an incident summary. Study \nparticipants with Copilot included 49% more of those key facts in \ntheir incident summary reports (p<.05). Because i t is uninformative \nto compare speeds across groups when one group is systematically \nmore accurate than another , the researchers looked at quality -\nadjusted completion times and f ound that subjects with Copilot \nwere 23% faster overall (p<.05 ). \n \nCompared with the previous study  looking at security novices , the \nsecurity professionals in this study experienced significantly \nsmaller accuracy gains. This is unsurprising given security \nprofessionals are more skilled in the tasks and therefore have less \nroom for improvement. Nonetheless , the results show that Copilot  \nallowed professionals to increase their speed without sacrificing \naccuracy.  \nExperiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, \nRied Peckham, Ulrike Gruber -Gremlich, and Tyler Smith ) \nWe next turn to Copilot implications in the sales function. \nResearchers conducted a lab study to understand how a “licensing \nchatbot,” trained on a corpus of materials around Microsoft’s \nlicensing policies\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(BEN EDELMAN<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-01T00:00:00<|>2024-12-31T00:00:00<|>Ben Edelman participated in the research study \"Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Understanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for Security Professionals (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, Roberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho) More details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security (Edelman et al. 2024))\n##\n(JAMES BONO<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-01T00:00:00<|>2024-12-31T00:00:00<|>James Bono participated in the research study \"Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Understanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for Security Professionals (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, Roberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho) More details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security (Edelman et al. 2024))\n##\n(SIDA PENG<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-01T00:00:00<|>2024-12-31T00:00:00<|>Sida Peng participated in the research study \"Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Understanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for Security Professionals (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, Roberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho) More details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security (Edelman et al. 2024))\n##\n(ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-01T00:00:00<|>2024-12-31T00:00:00<|>Roberto Rodriguez participated in the research study \"Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Understanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for Security Professionals (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, Roberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho) More details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security (Edelman et al. 2024))\n##\n(SANDRA HO<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-01T00:00:00<|>2024-12-31T00:00:00<|>Sandra Ho participated in the research study \"Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Understanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for Security Professionals (Ben Edelman, James Bono, Sida Peng, Roberto Rodriguez, and Sandra Ho) More details available in Randomized Controlled Trials for Microsoft Copilot for Security (Edelman et al. 2024))\n##\n(DONALD NGWE<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Donald Ngwe participated in the research study \"Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, Ried Peckham, Ulrike Gruber-Gremlich, and Tyler Smith))\n##\n(RIED PECKHAM<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Ried Peckham participated in the research study \"Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, Ried Peckham, Ulrike Gruber-Gremlich, and Tyler Smith))\n##\n(ULRIKE GRUBER-GREMLICH<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Ulrike Gruber-Gremlich participated in the research study \"Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, Ried Peckham, Ulrike Gruber-Gremlich, and Tyler Smith))\n##\n(TYLER SMITH<|>NONE<|>RESEARCH PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Tyler Smith participated in the research study \"Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers\" as mentioned in the text.<|>Experiment with Licensing Chatbot for Sellers (Donald Ngwe, Ried Peckham, Ulrike Gruber-Gremlich, and Tyler Smith))\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
