This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies presented in the first AI and Productivity report we published (Cambon et al. 2023). Actual information work, however, often includes a huge variety of tasks and much of the unstructured and informal work in people’s jobs is not yet directly supported by the first-generation of generative AI tools. Software developer workflows, for example, involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to shed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural complexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies of generative AI’s productivity impacts, and a major reason we hope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature Liu, N.

This effect might shrink or go away as model performance in other languages improves, and improving model performance in non-English languages is a major direction of research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g., Ahuja et al. 2023). Impact of Generative AI on Metacognition (Lev Tankelevitch, Viktor Kewenig, Auste Simkute, Ava Elizabeth Scott, Advait Sarkar, Abigail Sellen, and Sean Rintel) More details available in The Metacognitive Demands and Opportunities of Generative AI (Tankelevitch, Kewenig et al. 2024) Metacognitive demand—the effort needed for monitoring and controlling of one used it regularly or they lacked training or manager support for use. A Selection of New Lab Studies While the above research focuses on the use of generative AI in the wild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important trends that real-world use highlights. Given AI’s impact appears to vary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, diving more deeply into software development and extending the analysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, because Copilot is deployed globally, we’re also starting to see variation across languages, and thus present research studies looking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade-offs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work practices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are important to understand, and we share some early work in that space as well. Comparing the Effect of will, looking forward, be substantially redesigned to better integrate AI. Furthermore, generative AI is still under development and the tools that make use of it are improving rapidly. This means not only that the long-term effects of AI on productivity will differ from those observed in the short-term, but that we are likely to continue to see differences between local task effects and more global productivity effects. Research should try to capture and inform changes in workflows, task design, and business processes in addition to productivity effects for fixed tasks.\n\nOne result seen in the above studies and those in our prior work is the common disconnect between the time savings people report from Copilot use and the actual time savings measured. This has been observed not only across studies, where survey measures about time saved tend to be larger than telemetry-based measures, but also within a given study where researchers win across all four metrics.\nOur head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\n•Comprehensiveness. How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and details of the question?\n•Diversity. How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights on the question?\n•Empowerment. How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic?\n•Directness. How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and asked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner if one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible.\nTo account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.\nTable 2 shows an example of view the role of policy and regulation\nQuestions:\n1.

These individuals have been highlighted for various reasons, ranging from their professional achievements to their personal lives.\nTaylor Swift [...]Travis Kelce [...]Britney Spears [...]Justin Timberlake [...]\nThese figures are frequently covered due to their high-profile status and the public’s interest in their careers and personal lives. Their activities, whether in music, sports, or personal relationships, have significant cultural and economic impacts, as evidenced by the media coverage and public reactions.\nLLM\nDecisionComprehensiveness: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of public figures from a wider range of entertainment sectors, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital language. Researchers explored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot can facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different native languages.\n\nFirst, researchers asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a meeting recorded in English. Half the participants had to watch and listen to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, which gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to answer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 other native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, following the same script, but this time held in Japanese by native Japanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to Copilot.\n\nFor the meeting in English, participants with Copilot answered 16.4% more multiple-choice questions about the meeting correctly, and they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. Moreover, in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, people ang and Yang, 2024) dataset as indexed. Circles represent entity nodes with size proportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and Force Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels of hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum modularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n•Leaf-level communities. The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges, covariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until the token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in decreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominence), add descriptions of the source node, target node, linked covari AG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community summaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented retrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation of community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023) or federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also combined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and multi-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab et al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears need for thorough validation and human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of respondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.\n\nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to improving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI’s promise and concerned about threats to their job security. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on productivity and innovation, and to maintain developers’ trust and satisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into developers' workflows effectively. These may include acknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training programs.\nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts for GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan)\nThis study explored how developers’ problem-solving styles influence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub Copilot. The authors hypothesized that variations in developers’ problem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly influence their specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The importance score, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be interpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in predicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores indicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores range from 361 to 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power user classification within this dataset and model.\n\nAs with all surveys of this type, it is important to view all the above results through the lens of the limitations of the methodology. While the analysis reveals significant associations, causation cannot be conclusively established due to the observational nature of the data. Similarly, self-selection bias, response bias, and unmeasured confounding variables such as workplace culture and managerial support could influence the outcomes.\nCopilot Usage in the Workplace Survey (Alexia Cambon, Alex Farach, Margarita Bermejo as “Translation and language learning,” “Creative writing and editing,” and “Programming and scripting.” Overall, 72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains compared to 37% of Bing Search sessions. The researchers also used GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with each Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge work (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar pattern.\n\nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated with each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson and Krathwohl’s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001), which defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) to highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Over three-quarters of traditional search sessions, but less than half of Copilot conversations were for “Remember.
