The report \nsynthesizes research results from over a dozen  recent studies \nconducted by researchers at Microsoft, with a focus on studies of \ngenerative AI in actual workplace  environments . One of these is, to \nour knowledge , the largest , randomized controlled trial of the \nintroduction of generative AI into organizations.  Overall, the \nresearch suggests that generative AI is already aiding workers in \nbecoming more productive in their day -to-day jobs in significant \nways. However, t he influence of generative AI is subject to \nvariation by role, function, and organization and is contingent upon \nadoption and utilization.
