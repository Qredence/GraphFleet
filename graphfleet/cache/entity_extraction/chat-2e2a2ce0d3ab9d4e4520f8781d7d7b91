When comparing community summaries to source texts\nusing Graph RAG, community summaries generally provided a small but consistent improvement\nin answer comprehensiveness and diversity, except for root-level summaries. Intermediate-level\nsummaries in the Podcast dataset and low-level community summaries in the News dataset achieved\ncomprehensiveness win rates of 57% and 64%, respectively. Diversity win rates were 57% for\nPodcast intermediate-level summaries and 60% for News low-level community summaries. Table 3\nalso illustrates the scalability advantages of Graph RAG compared to source text summarization: for\nlow-level community summaries ( C3), Graph RAG required 26-33% fewer context tokens, while\nfor root-level community summaries ( C0), it required over 97% fewer tokens. For a modest drop in\nperformance compared with other global methods, root-level Graph RAG offers a highly efficient\nmethod for the iterative question answering that characterizes sensemaking activity, while retaining\nadvantages in comprehensiveness (72% win rate) and diversity (62% win rate) over na ¨ıve RAG.\nEmpowerment . Empowerment comparisons showed mixed results for both global approaches versus\nna¨ıve RAG ( SS) and Graph RAG approaches versus source text summarization ( TS). Ad-hoc LLM\nuse to analyze LLM reasoning for this measure indicated that the ability to provide specific exam-\nples, quotes, and citations was judged to be key to helping users reach an informed understanding.\nTuning element extraction prompts may help to retain more of these details in the Graph RAG index.\n4 Related Work\n4.1 RAG Approaches and Systems\nWhen using LLMs, RAG involves first retrieving relevant information from external data sources,\nthen adding this information to the context window of the LLM along with the original query (Ram\net al., 2023). Na ¨ıve RAG approaches (Gao et al., 2023) do this by converting documents to text,\nsplitting text into chunks, and embedding these chunks into a vector space in which similar positions\nrepresent similar semantics. Queries are then embedded into the same vector space, with the text\nchunks of the nearest kvectors used as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
