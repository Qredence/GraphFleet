Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

They used GPT -4 to classify each \nconversation and search by topic domain. They found that  chats \nwith Bing Copilot tend to focus on topics related to knowledge \nwork, such as “Translation and language learning ,” “Creative \nwriting and editing ,” and “Programming and scripting.”  Overall, \n72.9% of the Copilot conversations are in knowledge work domains \ncompared to 37% of Bing Search sessions . The researchers  also \nused GPT-4 to directly classify whether the task associated with \neach Copilot conversation and or search session was knowledge \nwork (instead of classifying based on the category) and see a similar \npattern.  \n \nResearchers then used GPT-4 to classify the main task associated \nwith each conversation or search sessions according to Anderson \nand Krathwohl’s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001) , \nwhich defines six categories from lowest complexity (for a human) \nto highest: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and \nCreate. Over three -quarters of traditional search sessions, but less \nthan half of Copilot conversations were for “Remember” tasks. \nGrouping “Remember” and “Understand ” as low-complexity  tasks \nand the rest as high -complexity, the authors found 13.4 % of \ntraditional search sessions and 37% of Copilot sessions were high -\ncomplexity. That is, AI -augmented search tended to be in higher \ncomplexity domains than traditional search.  \n \nResearchers interpret the shift in domain and complexity of tasks \nbetween traditional search and Copilot as generative AI  helping people with tasks that used to be done with much more human \neffort; LLMs shift the frontier of which tasks machines can help \nwith – and how helpful they are.  Researchers caveat that these \nresults are based on early usage of Bing Copilot and patterns may \nchange as the tools develop and users gain experience working with \nthem. Nonetheless, the study suggests that LLMs will affect \nsubstantial changes in how people use search -based tools and \naccomplish knowledge work tasks more broadly.  \n \nThe study could not identify when people were using consumer \nCopilot for their jobs, but the high number of knowledge work tasks \nis consistent with\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
