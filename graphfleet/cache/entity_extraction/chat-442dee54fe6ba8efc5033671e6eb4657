This process allows the model to\nutilize the information stored in the global workspace efficiently to refine responses and\nensure accurate problem solving.\nThrough these principles, Sibyl aims to advance the development of LLM-based agents, shifting to-\nwards a model that is not only more aligned with human cognitive processes but also more adaptable\nand capable of handling the complexities of real-world applications. This holistic approach is key\nto achieving a deeper, more nuanced interaction with information, leading to better-informed, more\nreliable decision-making for LLM-based agents.\n2.2 T OOL PLANNER\nThe tool planner in Sibyl is a specialized module designed to select the most suitable (tool, function,\nparameters) triplets and parameters to address incoming queries step by step. Given the planning\nprompt, it assesses the given query and any associated step history to determine the most effective\ntools, functions, and parameters for execution. If the query can be resolved straightforwardly and\ndoes not require additional tools, the planner can also select \u201cNone\u201d, indicating that no additional\ntools are required for that particular step.\n2.3 E XTERNAL INFORMATION AQUISITION CHANNEL\nThe external information acquisition channel plays a pivotal role in enhancing the agent\u2019s ability to\nprocess and utilize information effectively. It first obtains the output of the tool planner, which spec-\nifies the tool, function, and parameters to be used. Upon receiving these directives, the appropriate\ntools are activated to gather and return the needed information.\nThen, the channel performs analysis to extract and verify relevant information for the query. This\ninvolves:\n\u2022 Analyzing the tool results to extract relevant data that directly contributes to answering the\nquestion.\n4Technical Report\n\u2022 Verifying the extracted information against the original question to ensure its accuracy and\nrelevance.\n\u2022 Recording new facts only if they provide unique and necessary information that has not\nalready been captured in the step history.\n\u2022 Deciding if the tool result sufficiently answers the query or if further data gathering is\nnecessary.\nIf the information from the current step is insufficient, the channel plans a follow-up step to gather\nmore data, choosing the next tool and query that will efficiently lead to the ultimate goal. This\nplanning is detailed, focusing on minimizing unnecessary steps and emphasizing direct and efficient\nmethods to gather required information.\nConsidering that the information obtained is usually lengthy and noisy, we propose a representation\nlanguage to selectively compress the information inspired by Lee et al. (2024). Unlike simple data\nappending, selective compression involves integrating only those pieces of information that directly\ncontribute to resolving the query at hand. This is exactly in line with the goal of the dialogue state\ntracking module in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is designed to selectively compress past\ninformation related to accomplish tasks. This approach not only minimizes data redundancy but also\nenhances the relevance and quality of information maintained in the system\u2019s memory. Specifically,\nwe design a structured output in this step that includes sections for recording the incremental factual\ninformation compared to history, explanations of why choosing the next step and how it contributes\nto answering the question, and the detailed plan of the next step.\n2.4 M ULTI -AGENT DEBATE -BASED JURY\nThe Society of Mind Theory , proposed by Marvin Minsky, provides a fundamental underpinning\nfor the design of the jury system in the Sibyl framework. It posits that the mind is composed of a\nmultitude of semi-autonomous agents, each responsible for different aspects of intellectual opera-\ntion, making complex cognitive processes emerge from the interactions and negotiations between\nsimpler, specialized processes. These agents work in concert, albeit through a decentralized process\nof negotiation and cooperation, much like a society (Minsky, 1988). This inspired the multi-agent\ndebate-based jury mechanism in the Sibyl framework, where multiple agents can discuss and analyze\nproblems, mimicking the cooperative yet independent interaction of Minsky\u2019s mental agents.\nHere we instantiate the jury with a minimal implementation using AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), where\ntwo primary roles are defined:\n\u2022Actor : This agent attempts to answer the question, explain their thought process in detail,\nand consider feedback from others critically.\n\u2022Critic : The role of this agent is to identify logical or intellectual errors in the actor\u2019s rea-\nsoning.\nThese roles allow for a structured yet flexible interaction and play a vital role in ensuring the logical\ncoherence and intellectual integrity of the responses provided. We leave the exploration of diverse\norganizational forms for LLM-based agents for future work, including collaborative models like\nadvisory councils.\nIn addition, the Sibyl framework employs a majority vote ensemble method to enhance the stability\nand quality of the output answers. This method aggregates decisions or suggestions from multi-\nple inferences, using their consensus to finalize the answer. This approach is particularly effective\nin mitigating individual errors in agent responses, leading to more reliable and accurate problem\nsolving.\n2.5 G LOBAL WORKSPACE\nThe concept of the global workspace in Sibyl is deeply influenced by Global Workspace Theory\n(Baars, 1993; 2005), which suggests that the brain consists of many specialized processes or mod-\nules that operate simultaneously, with a significant portion functioning unconsciously. Attention\nserves as a spotlight that elevates some of these unconscious activities to conscious awareness within\n5Technical Report\nthe global workspace. This workspace acts as a crucial hub for the broadcasting and integration of\ninformation, allowing its distribution across various modules. This theoretical backdrop inspires\nthe design of the global workspace as an integrative platform for various modules within the Sibyl\nframework, facilitating seamless information sharing and a comprehensive understanding of com-\nplex problems.\nThe global workspace acts as a central hub where different modules can broadcast their outputs and\ninsights. This mechanism ensures that despite the modular nature of the system, there is a cohesive\nand unified approach to problem solving. In addition, information within the global workspace is\nwell-structured and denoised, which not only ensures that the data is easy to access and manipu-\nlate by LLMs but also simplifies the debugging and case-analysis processes for human developers.\nBy implementing this global workspace, the framework supports complex information handling and\nlong reasoning sequences, facilitating the evolution from rapid, reflexive responses (System-1 think-\ning) to more deliberate and structured problem solving (System-2 thinking).\n3 E XPERIMENTS\nDatasets We conducted our evaluations on the GAIA dataset (Mialon et al., 2023), a benchmark\ntailored for general AI assistants. The GAIA dataset is designed to reflect tasks that align closely\nwith human perceptual capabilities, including visual, auditory, and textual modalities. This dataset\nchallenges general-purpose assistants with complex reasoning tasks that even require dozens of steps\nto solve, similar to those encountered by humans. Such a design significantly magnifies the impact of\nerror propagation, providing a robust evaluation of problem-solving and error-handling capabilities\nfor LLM-based agents.\n3.1 S ETTINGS\nIn our experimental setup for the Sibyl framework, we utilized two primary tools: a web browser and\na Python-based code interpreter. Details of these tools are described in the Appendix A. To balance\nbudget constraints and time cost, we only use the GPT-4o API within the text modal, and limit the\nmaximum number of reasoning steps of the model to 20.\n3.2 B ASELINES\nWe compared it against several established baselines on GAIA: 1) GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023)\nwith and without manually configured plugins, 2) AutoGPT-4 (Gravitas, 2023), which integrates\nAutoGPT with a GPT-4 backend, 3) An LLM-based agent implemented by AutoGen (Wu et al.,\n2023), a framework designed for automating complex multi-agent scenarios, and 4) FRIDAY (Wu\net al., 2024), an advanced agent utilizing OS-Copilot for automating a broad spectrum of computer\ntasks, capable of interfacing with various operating system elements including web browsers, code\nterminals, and multimedia.\n3.3 M AINRESULTS\nModel Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Overall\nAutoGen 47.31 28.93 14.58 32.33\nFRIDAY 40.86 20.13 6.12 24.25\nAutoGPT4 15.05 0.63 0.00 5.00\nGPT4 Turbo 9.68 6.92 0.00 6.67\nGPT4 w/ plugins 30.30 9.70 0.00 14.6\nGPT4 9.68 1.89 0.00 4.00\nGPT3.5 4.30 1.89 2.08 2.67\nSibyl 47.31 32.70 16.33 34.55\nTable 1: Performance on the GAIA test set.Model Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Overall\nAutoGen 54.72 38.37 11.54 39.39\nFRIDAY 45.28 34.88 11.54 34.55\nAutoGPT4 13.21 0.00 3.85 4.85\nGPT4 Turbo 20.75 5.81 0.00 9.70\nGPT4 w/ plugins 30.30 9.70 0.00 14.60\nGPT4 15.09 2.33 0.00 6.06\nGPT3.5 7.55 4.65 0.00 4.85\nSibyl 60.38 36.05 11.54 40.00\nTable 2: Performance on the GAIA valida-\ntion set.\nWe present the results of our experiments on both the test and validation sets of the GAIA dataset in\ntable 1 and 2, respectively.

This improvement\nis noteworthy given that these levels require longer steps for humans to solve, demonstrating Sibyl \u2019s\nenhanced ability to mitigate error propagation in complex reasoning processes. Furthermore, the\ncomparison of performances on the test and validation sets indicates that Sibyl exhibits superior\ngeneralization capabilities. The smaller decline in accuracy from validation to test set (40.00 to\n34.55) compared to AutoGen (39.39 to 32.33) and FRIDAY (34.55 to 24.25) underscores Sibyl \u2019s\nrobustness across different operational environments.\nWe also analyze the number of steps required to solve problems compared to humans. As shown in\nTable 3, in problems where the Sibyl agent was correct, it consistently outperformed humans in effi-\nciency, using significantly fewer steps in levels 1 through 3. This underscores the Sibyl \u2019s capability\nto streamline decision-making processes effectively. In addition, further insights are gained from\nFigure 2, which plots the number of steps taken by humans versus those taken by the Sibyl agent\nfor each question in the GAIA validation set. These results demonstrate that despite being limited\nto a maximum of 20 reasoning steps, the Sibyl agent exhibited a high level of reasoning efficiency,\nindicating strong capability to mitigate unnecessary reasoning and suppress error propagation.\n3.4 A BLATION STUDIES\nWe further conduct the ablation studies on the validation set of GAIA to investigate the individual\ncontributions of specific components within the Sibyl framework. We mainly focus on two main\ncomponents: the multi-agent debate-based jury and the majority vote-based ensemble. As shown\nin 4, the removal of the multi-agent debate component resulted in a notable performance drop in\nthe Level 1, which indicates that this component significantly boosts the accuracy for basic question\ntypes. However, its removal did not markedly affect the performance in the more challenging Levels\n2 and 3. This suggests that while the multi-agent debate is crucial for resolving simpler queries\neffectively, it does not substantially influence the outcome of more complex reasoning tasks.\nTo evaluate the impact of the ensemble component, we report the average accuracy across three\nseparate runs to ensure a fair comparison against the ensemble configuration. The individual runs\nyielded overall accuracies of 40.61, 34.55, and 35.15, respectively, with an average of 36.77, com-\npared to the ensemble\u2019s overall performance of 40.00.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "=\"gpt-4o\"", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
