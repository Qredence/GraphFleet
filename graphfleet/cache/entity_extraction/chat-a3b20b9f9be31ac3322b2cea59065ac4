Opencodeinterpreter: Integrating code generation with execution and refinement.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2402.14658 , 2024.\n10Technical Report\nA D ETAILS OF TOOLS\nIn the development of Sibyl , we reuse the tools from the AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023). Below is\na detailed description of each tool and its functions, providing insights into how these tools are\nutilized within the framework to process and interact with web content efficiently.\nWeb Browser The web browser tool in Sibyl is designed to perform a variety of functions that\nfacilitate interaction with web pages. These functions are shown in table 5.\nFunction Description\ninformational web search Search for information based on a query and return results.\nnavigational web search Navigate directly to a specific URL based on a search query.\nvisit page Directly access a webpage by URL.\npage up Scroll up one page in the current view.\npage down Scroll down one page in the current view.\ndownload file Download and attempt to return the text of a file.\nfind onpage ctrlf Find and highlight text on a page using a search term.\nfind next Move to the next occurrence of the search term on a page.\nTable 5: Web Browser Tool Functions\nAdditionally, the web browser tool can convert the content of web pages into various formats for bet-\nter processing, including plain text, HTML, and formats specific to sites like Wikipedia, YouTube,\nas well as document formats like DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and multimedia formats such as WA V , MP3\n(via ASR), and images (via OCR).\nComputer Terminal The computer terminal tool serves as a code interpreter within the Sibyl\nsystem. This tool allows the execution of Python code, facilitating dynamic computation and pro-\ncessing tasks which are crucial for complex problem solving and data manipulation within the AI\nframework.\nThese tools and their functionalities are important in enabling the Sibyl agent to navigate, inter-\npret, and interact with the digital world effectively, mirroring human-like web browsing and data\nprocessing capabilities.\nB E THICS STATEMENT\nBy refining the ability to parse and process multifaceted information, Sibyl helps in delivering more\naccurate and reliable outputs during complex reasoning in real-world scenarios. This progression\nhelps improve the reliability of responses and reduce the occurrence of hallucinations in the outputs\nof these models. In addition, during the evaluation phase, we implemented rigorous monitoring of\nthe reasoning processes to identify and prevent any potentially harmful actions that could be exe-\ncuted by the Sibyl system. This precautionary measure is essential to ensure that while the system\nimproves in autonomy, it remains within the bounds of ethical operation. Due to the versatility of\ngeneral purpose LLM-based agents, we strongly recommend that users of Sibyl also remain vigilant\nregarding the outputs produced, recognizing the potential impacts that these could have if misap-\nplied. Users are urged to ensure that the deployment of Sibyl is aligned with ethical standards and\nnot used for malicious purposes.\n11Technical Report\nC P ROMPTS\nPrompt Used in Tool Planner\nYou are a helpful AI assistant .\nI'll give you a question and a set of tools .
