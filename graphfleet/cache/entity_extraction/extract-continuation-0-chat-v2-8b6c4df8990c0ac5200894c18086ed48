Given such a graph, a variety of community\ndetection algorithms may be used to partition the graph into communities of nodes with stronger\nconnections to one another than to the other nodes in the graph (e.g., see the surveys by Fortu-\nnato, 2010 and Jin et al., 2021). In our pipeline, we use Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) on account of\nits ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently (Figure 3).\nEach level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a\nmutually-exclusive, collective-exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization.\n2.5 Graph Communities →Community Summaries\nThe next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using\na method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in\ntheir own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may\nthemselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question. For example, a user\nmay scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then\nfollow links to the reports at the lower level that provide more details for each of the subtopics. Here,\nhowever, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\nCommunity summaries are generated in the following way:\n4(a) Root communities at level 0 (b) Sub-communities at level 1\nFigure 3: Graph communities detected using the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) over the\nMultiHop-RAG (T\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## \n(\"entity\"<|>COMMON ENTITY<|>CONCEPT, ENTITY<|>A general term referring to an entity that may have multiple name variations but is connected to a shared set of closely-related entities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLMS<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on rich descriptive text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>Graph structures that rely on concise and consistent knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object) for downstream reasoning tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOMOGENEOUS UNDIRECTED WEIGHTED GRAPH<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>A type of graph where entity nodes are connected by relationship edges, with edge weights representing normalized counts of detected relationship instances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS<|>TECHNOLOGY, METHOD<|>Algorithms used to partition a graph into communities of nodes with stronger connections to one another than to other nodes in the graph)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEIDEN<|>TECHNOLOGY, METHOD<|>A community detection algorithm known for its ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIERARCHICAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE<|>CONCEPT, STRUCTURE<|>A multi-level structure in which communities are organized in a hierarchy, allowing for divide-and-conquer global summarization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL SUMMARIZATION<|>ACTIVITY, TASK<|>The process of summarizing the global structure and semantics of a dataset, often using community summaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMUNITY SUMMARIES<|>DOCUMENT, SUMMARY<|>Report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, useful for understanding the global structure and semantics of the dataset)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTIHOP-RAG<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>A specific graph-based index used for answering global queries, over which the Leiden algorithm is applied)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMON ENTITY<|>LLMS<|>LLMs can handle rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure, which includes common entities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS<|>LLMS<|>Knowledge graphs typically rely on concise and consistent knowledge triples, which is different from the rich descriptive text used by LLMs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOMOGENEOUS UNDIRECTED WEIGHTED GRAPH<|>COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS<|>Community detection algorithms are used to partition homogeneous undirected weighted graphs into communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEIDEN<|>COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS<|>Leiden is a specific community detection algorithm used for partitioning graphs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIERARCHICAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE<|>LEIDEN<|>Leiden algorithm is known for its ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL SUMMARIZATION<|>HIERARCHICAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE<|>Hierarchical community structure enables divide-and-conquer global summarization<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMUNITY SUMMARIES<|>GLOBAL SUMMARIZATION<|>Community summaries are used as part of the process for global summarization<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTIHOP-RAG<|>LEIDEN<|>The Leiden algorithm is applied over the MultiHop-RAG for detecting graph communities<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
