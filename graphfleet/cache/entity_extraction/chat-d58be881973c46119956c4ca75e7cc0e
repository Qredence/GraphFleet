Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is \"English.\" as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Of the 47 organizations that \nhave been in the study the longest, 10 saw a statistically significant \ndecrease in attended meetings, with an average decrease of .39 \nmeetings per day on a pre -Copilot average of 3 meetings. On the \nother hand, 14 customers saw a statistically significa nt increase in \nmeetings with an average increase of .36 meetings per day on a pre -\nCopilot average of 2 meetings. The difference in baseline average \nsuggests that increases  in meetings  attended were more likely at \norganizations with low levels of baseline Teams usage. The \nremaining customers did not see a statistically significant change in \nthe number of Teams meetings. The middle graph in Figure 1 plots \nthe effect for each customer.  \n \nTeams Copilot provides meeting summaries and uses the transcript \nto answer questions users may ask of it during or after a meeting, \nbut only works for meetings that are executed in Teams.  Thus, \nhaving access gives people an additional reason to have meetings \nin Teams (instead of only in -person or via another app) , so \nincreases could reflect increases in the use of Teams that are not \nindicative of increases in overall meetings. More generally, if \nCopilot makes meetings both more effective and more efficient , \nthat can generate conflicting effects : more efficient meetings \nrequire less time and fewer follow -up meetings, but if meetings \nbecome more effective collaboration tools, they may be used for a \nwider range of projects or tasks.  \n \nWith respect to documents, people with Copilot also created and \nedited more documents than those without Copilot. Overall people \nedited 10% more documents, with heavy users of Word, Excel, and \nPowerPoint seeing an increase of 13% (on a higher baseline). So me \norganizations saw increases in the 25 -30% range. One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
