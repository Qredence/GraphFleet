Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is \"English.\" as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is \"English.\", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\ntext:\n he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often \nincludes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and \ninformal work in people’s jobs is not yet directly supported by the \nfirst-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer \nworkflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI’s productivity impacts , and a major reason we \nhope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>LAB<|>LOCATION, RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT<|>The lab is where tasks are studied to hypothesize the performance of generative AI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate content, such as text, based on input data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AI AND PRODUCTIVITY REPORT<|>DOCUMENT, PUBLICATION<|>A report published by Cambon et al. in 2023 focusing on the performance of generative AI in various tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFORMATION WORK<|>ACTIVITY, TASK<|>Information work includes a variety of tasks, often unstructured and informal, that are part of people's jobs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST-GENERATION GENERATIVE AI TOOLS<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>The initial versions of generative AI tools that support specific tasks but not the full range of unstructured work)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER WORKFLOWS<|>ACTIVITY, TASK<|>The comprehensive set of activities involved in software development, beyond just coding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB COPILOT<|>TECHNOLOGY, TOOL<|>A generative AI tool that assists with hands-on coding tasks for software developers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIELD STUDIES<|>RESEARCH METHOD, STUDY TYPE<|>Studies conducted in natural settings to observe the real-world impacts of generative AI on productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTIVITY DYNAMICS<|>CONCEPT, PHENOMENON<|>The various factors and interactions that affect productivity when using generative AI in real-world workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITERATURE<|>BODY OF WORK, RESEARCH<|>The collection of academic and professional studies and publications on a given topic)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAB<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The lab is where tasks are studied to hypothesize the performance of generative AI<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AI AND PRODUCTIVITY REPORT<|>GENERATIVE AI<|>The report focuses on the performance of generative AI in various tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INFORMATION WORK<|>FIRST-GENERATION GENERATIVE AI TOOLS<|>First-generation generative AI tools do not yet directly support much of the unstructured and informal information work<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER WORKFLOWS<|>GITHUB COPILOT<|>GitHub Copilot supports hands-on coding, which is a part of software developer workflows<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIELD STUDIES<|>PRODUCTIVITY DYNAMICS<|>Field studies help shed light on the productivity dynamics of generative AI in real-world settings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIELD STUDIES<|>LITERATURE<|>The hope is to see more field studies emerging in the literature to understand generative AI's productivity impacts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\ntext:\nLiu, N.
