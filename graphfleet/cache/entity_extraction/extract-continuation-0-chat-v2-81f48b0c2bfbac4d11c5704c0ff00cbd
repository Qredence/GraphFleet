Moreover, there may be differences across \nprofessions in how people perceive the subjective metrics like \nquality and fulfillment  that the survey asked about .   \nTowards Effective AI Support for Developers: A Survey of \nDesires and Concerns (Mansi Khemka  and Brian Houck ) \nMore details available in Towards Effective AI Support for \nDevelopers: A Survey of Desires and Concerns  (Khemka and \nHouck, 2024 ).  \nMicrosoft researchers surveyed 800 Microsoft developers and \nexplored the opportunities and concerns that they have with using \nAI in their work.  Responses indicated that developers most want to \nsee AI help with  automating routine tasks, like generating unit tests \nand writing documentation, which they find monotonous but \nessential. Specifically, 44% of respondents highlighted generating \ntests as a top area where AI could alleviate the burden and improve \ndeveloper experience . Additionally, 42% noted AI's potential in \nanalyzing code for defects and optimizations, seeing it as a virtual \npair-programming partner. Writing documentation was another \narea of interest, with 37%  seeing AI's potential in automating this \ncrucial but often neglected task.  \n \nHowever, developers also voiced significant concerns. The top \nworry (29%) was that AI might not be as helpful as expected . \nAnother major concern (21%) was that AI might introduce defects \nor vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for thorough validation \nand human oversight. Job security was a worry for 10% of \nrespondents, reflecting fears of AI encroaching on their roles.  \n \nThese learnings suggest developers view AI as helpful to \nimproving aspects of their workflows, even as they remain uncertain of AI’s promise and concerned about threats to their job \nsecurity. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty on \nproductivity and innovation, and to maintain developers ’ trust and \nsatisfaction, organizations may identify ways to integrate AI into \ndevelopers' workflows effectively. These may include \nacknowledging and addressing concerns and offering training \nprograms.  \nProblem-Solving Styles and Confidence Generating Prompts \nfor GitHub Copilot (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study explored how developers ’ problem-solving styles \ninfluence their confidence when generating prompts for GitHub \nCopilot.
