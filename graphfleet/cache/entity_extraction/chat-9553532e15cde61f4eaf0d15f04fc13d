Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast\ndataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset. Table 3 shows the\nnumber of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.\nGlobal approaches vs. na ¨ıve RAG . As shown in Figure 4, global approaches consistently out-\nperformed the na ¨ıve RAG ( SS) approach in both comprehensiveness and diversity metrics across\ndatasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 72-83%\nfor Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82%\nand 62-71% respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test also achieved the expected results,\ni.e., that na ¨ıve RAG produces the most direct responses across all comparisons.\n9Podcast Transcripts News Articles\nC0 C1 C2 C3 TS C0 C1 C2 C3 TS\nUnits 34 367 969 1310 1669 55 555 1797 2142 3197\nTokens 26657 225756 565720 746100 1014611 39770 352641 980898 1140266 1707694\n% Max 2.6 22.2 55.8 73.5 100 2.3 20.7 57.4 66.8 100\nTable 3: Number of context units (community summaries for C0-C3 and text chunks for TS), corre-\nsponding token counts, and percentage of the maximum token count.
