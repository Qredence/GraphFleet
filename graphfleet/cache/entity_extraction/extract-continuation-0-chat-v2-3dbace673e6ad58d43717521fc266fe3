Following a comparison across \nroles, we take a closer look at the software development functio n. \nBecause of the earlier availability of GitHub Copilot, there is a lot \nof research in that area which may lend insight  to effects to be \nexpected in  other types of information work.  \nComparing across Roles in Copilot Usage in the Workplace \nSurvey (Alexia Cambon , Alex Farach , Margarita Bermejo -Cano, \nand Eric Knudsen ) \nThe Copilot Usage in the Workplace Survey  described above \nhelped researchers understand broad patterns, but also allowed us  \nto look at data by job type to see  the impact on specific roles and \nfunctions, focusing on  two dimensions: adoption and perceived \nbenefits. All reported differences are statistically  significant at \np<.05, using ANOVA tests, with the Benjamini -Hochberg False \nDiscovery Rate (FDR) control procedure applied.  \n \nWhen asked about usage (1=never, 5=daily), respondents across \nnearly all functions reported using Copilot in Teams  at least \nweekly, with some functions like sales and product development \nreporting daily usage (average response scores of 4.66 and 4.55, \nrespectively). Others functions like legal and supply chain reported \nsomewhat lower usage (4.03 and 3.88, respectively). Reported \nusage of Copilot in Outlook  was generally slightly lower, but with \nsimilar patterns across roles .  \n \nRespondents with communication -focused responsibilities \ninvolving repetitive and/or content creation tasks supported by \ncurrent AI capabilities also reported the most benefits from Copilot , \nincluding productivity , fulfillment , work quality improvements , \nand efficiency .
