With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), we are already witnessing\nattempts to automate human-like sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Mi-\ncrosoft, 2023) and intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023), where sensemaking is defined as\nPreprint.

This\nindex spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims) that have\nbeen detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the dataset.\nCommunity detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index into\ngroups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both index-\ning time and query time. The “global answer” to a given query is produced using a final round of\nquery-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.\n“a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and\nevents) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively ” (Klein et al., 2006a). Supporting\nhuman-led sensemaking over entire text corpora, however, needs a way for people to both apply and\nrefine their mental model of the data (Klein et al., 2006b) by asking questions of a global nature.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to answering\nuser questions over entire datasets, but it is designed for situations where these answers are contained\nlocally within regions\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
