This has \nbegun to allow researchers at Microsoft and elsewhere to study how \nthe first wave of generative AI tools impacts information work in \nreal-world contexts.  \n \nAccordingly, this second Microsoft AI and Productivity Report \nfocuses on Microsoft studies that explore how people apply Copilot  \nand other generative AI tools  to their regular work. The report also \ndescribes learnings from a small set of additional lab experiments \nthat suggest new ways that we might see the impact of Copilot in -\nthe-wild in future studies. Overall, the results – including those \nfrom what we believe is the single largest randomized controlled \ntrial on the introduction of generative AI in real  workplaces – point \nto several high -level observations:  \n \n• Generative AI is already helping people be measurably more  \nproductive in their day -to-day jobs. \n• As expected, the productivity story in real -world workflows \nis more complex than observed in lab studies.   \n• Productivity gains associated with generative  AI, including \ntime and accuracy, vary by role, function and organization . \n• Variance in adoption and utilization influen ces AI’s impact. \n• Early studies suggest generative  AI may affect the cognitive \neffort required for task completion.   Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n2 \n The goal of th is report is to synthesize learnings from studies from \naround the company versus to completely describe each individual \nstudy. Many of the studies are or will be the subject of dedicated \nreports or research papers , and we have provided links to those \ndocuments where they are already available. Most of the studies \nhave not yet been through peer review and as such they have not \nhad the chance thus far to incorporate external reviewer feedback. \nFurther, before continuing , it is important to acknowledge that all \nwork here was funded by Microsoft, which has a commercial \ninterest in improving and demonstrating the degree to which \nCopilot increases worker productivity.  \n2 RELATED WORK  \nResearchers outside of Microsoft also have been moving to study \ngenerative AI ’s impact on productivity in real-world contexts. This \nsection highlights a few of the most notable studies in this space . \nThese studies  consistently show that the gains predicted by  lab \nstudies do indeed translate into significant impact when AI is used \nfor real work .
