Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,\nMicrosoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669\n×600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1 million tokens).\n•News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September\n2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,\ntechnology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 ×\n600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1.7 million tokens).\n3.2 Queries\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\nthe associated question sets target explicit fact retrieval rather than summarization for the purpose\nof data sensemaking, i.e., the process though which people inspect, engage with, and contextualize\ndata within the broader scope of real-world activities (Koesten et al., 2021). Similarly, methods for\nextracting latent summarization queries from source texts also exist (Xu and Lapata, 2021), but such\nextracted questions can target details that betray prior knowledge of the texts.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for more global sensemaking tasks, we need questions\nthat convey only a high-level understanding of dataset contents, and not the details of specific texts.\nWe used an activity-centered approach to automate the generation of such questions: given a short\ndescription of a dataset, we asked the LLM to identify Npotential users and Ntasks per user,\nthen for each (user, task) combination, we asked the LLM to generate Nquestions that require\nunderstanding of the entire corpus. For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n63.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## \n(\"entity\"<|>DATASETS<|>DATA, COLLECTION<|>Two datasets in the one million token range, each equivalent to about 10 novels of text and representative of the kind of corpora that users may encounter in their real-world activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODCAST TRANSCRIPTS<|>DATA, TEXT<|>Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott, Microsoft CTO, and other technology leaders.
