We believe this \nresearch is the largest controlled study of productivity impacts in \nreal-world generative AI deployments to date.   \nResearchers worked with  organizations in the Copilot for Microsoft \n365 (M365) Early Access Program to create a randomized control \ntrial. Copilot for Microsoft 365  combines  generative AI tools in \napplications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, \nand others. Each organization set aside at least 50 licenses to be \nrandomly assigned among 100 or more M icrosoft 365 users \nnominated  by the organization . Researchers partnered closely with \nIT administrators and business decision -makers in each of the over \n60 participating organizations to explain the need for \nrandomization and obtain buy -in. To ensure privacy, r esearchers Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n3 \n looked only at aggregate effects and did not analyze or report \nindividual -level data . \n \nUsing metadata from M icrosoft 365 in these organizations, \nresearchers compared how email, meeting, and document behavior \ndiffered based on being assigned a Copilot license. Researchers \nfound that on average,  those with Copilot for Microsoft 365  read \n11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting \nwith them, compared to people without Copilot. Some \norganizations saw larger effects with relative decreases of up to 20 \nor 25% in both emails read and time spent interacting with email. \nThe top grap h in Figure 1 shows the effects across organizations. \nThe researchers hypothesize that  the summarize emails feature in \nCopilot for Outlook and the Copilot chat function may have \nallowed workers to retrieve information without reading or \nrereading individual  emails. \n \nThe effects of Copilot on the number of meetings attended (via \nMicrosoft  Teams) were more complex, with some organizations \nseeing significant increases , others seeing significant decreases , \nand others seeing no significant effect .\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
