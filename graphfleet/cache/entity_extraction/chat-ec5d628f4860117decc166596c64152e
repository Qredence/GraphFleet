Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n•Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covariates, and the edge itself.\n•Higher-level communities . If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the con-\ntext window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries\nwithin the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element\nsummary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their\nassociated element summaries (longer) until fit within the context window is achieved.\n2.6 Community Summaries →Community Answers →Global Answer\nGiven a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate\na final answer in a multi-stage process. The hierarchical nature of the community structure also\nmeans that questions can be answered using the community summaries from different levels, raising\nthe question of whether a particular level in the hierarchical community structure offers the best\nbalance of summary detail and scope for general sensemaking questions (evaluated in section 3).\nFor a given community level, the global answer to any user query is generated as follows:\n•Prepare community summaries . Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided\ninto chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed\nacross chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost)\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
