They f ound that the AI tool \ndecreased time spent writing posts and increase d the number of posts completed but  had no effect on the number of hires. The \nresearchers suggest this may be because the additional jobs that get \nposted were less important than their other jobs and using AI to \ndraft may have caused employers to  exert less effort in writing the \njob posts, leaving them with fewer well -matched applicants.  In \nanother example, Yeverechyahu et al . (2024) studied generative AI \neffects on coding activity, both quantity and type . Specifically, the \nauthors compared  open-source repositories for packages in Python \n(which was supported by GitHub Copilot) to R (which was not). \nThey found a significant jump in contributions due to GitHub \nCopilot. Of note, the increase was larger for contributions  \ncategorized as “maintenance solutions” than for those categorized \nas “new code development ,” which require more extrapolative \nthinking.  \n \nIn addition to impacting human behavior, t he real-world presence \nof generative AI may also influence the future behavior of AI \nsystems themselves . Rio-Chanona et al. (2023) provide evidence \nthat the availability of generative AI programming tools \nsubstantially reduced participation in online programming forums \nthat produce important training data for these tools . This suggests \nthat in some contexts  a “paradox of reuse” dynamics (Taraborelli \n2015; McMahon  et al. 2017) might be emerging in the generative \nAI ecosystem. These dynamics could significantly harm \nproductivity ga ins if not properly addressed  (Vincent 2022).  \n3 STUDIES AND RESULTS  \nWe now provide an overview of  studies recently conducted  by \nresearchers at Microsoft , focusing in particular on those that speak \nto real-world implications of generative AI.  \nStudies of workers using AI on the job  \nEarly Access Program Telemetry Study (Eleanor Dillon, Sonia \nJaffe, Sida Peng , and Alexia Cambon ) \nWorking with over 60 organizations and including over 6000 \nindividual employees across a wide range of industries and \noccupations, researchers  conducted a large-scale randomized \ncontrolled\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
