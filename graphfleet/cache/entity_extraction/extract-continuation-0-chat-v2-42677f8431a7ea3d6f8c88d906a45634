This \nis a statistically significant difference  (p<.05). The changes are \nsomewhat small in percentage point terms because the baseline \naccuracy is so high, but Copilot closed 38.5% of the gap to perfect \naccuracy for those working in their native language (p<0.10) and \nclosed 84.6% of the gap for those working in (non -native) English \n(p<.05). \n  \nThe role of Copilot in communication for non -native speakers has \nalso come up in researchers’ interviews with people using Copilot \nin their day -to-day work. At global companies, Copilot may help \npeople feel more confident that they are communicating \neffectively. That said, Copilot also raises concerns about potentially \nincreasing the dominance of majority languages: in interviews \nconducted by other researchers at Microsoft, some people reported \nchanging the language in which meetings were held to one where \nCopilot was more effective. This effect might shrink or go away as \nmodel performance in other languages improves, and improving \nmodel performance in non -English languages is a major direction \nof research at Microsoft and around the world (e.g. , Ahuja et al. \n2023).
