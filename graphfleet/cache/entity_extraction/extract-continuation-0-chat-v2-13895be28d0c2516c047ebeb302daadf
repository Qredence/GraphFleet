For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n63.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C0,C1,C2,C3), a text summarization method applying our map-reduce approach\ndirectly to source texts ( TS), and a na ¨ıve “semantic search” RAG approach ( SS):\n•CO. Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.\n•C1. Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities\nof C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected down.\n•C2. Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-\ncommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected down.\n•C3. Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These\nare sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected down.\n•TS. The same method as in subsection 2.6, except source texts (rather than community\nsummaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.\n•SS. An implementation of na ¨ıve RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the\navailable context window until the specified token limit is reached.\nThe size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across\nall six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context\ninformation used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.\nThe graph index supporting conditions C0-C3was created using our generic prompts for entity and\nrelationship extraction only, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the\ndata. The graph indexing process used a context window size of 600 tokens with 1 gleaning for the\nPodcast dataset and 0 gleanings for the News dataset.\n3.4 Metrics\nLLMs have been shown to be good evaluators of natural language generation, achieving state-of-\nthe-art or competitive results compared against human judgements (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al.,\n2024). While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are\nknown, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts\n######################\noutput:\n"},
