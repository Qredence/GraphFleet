These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Reetchatha Rangareddy ) \nThis study considered  how engineering system satisfaction (as \nmeasured by a net satisfaction score or NSAT) changed for \nMicrosoft employees who adopted GitHub Copilot compared to \nthose who did not. Researchers  examined  anonymized data  on Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n7 \n >30,000 software engineers , some of whom  had installed and used \nGitHub Copilot between the two waves of Microsoft’s  bi-annual \nEmployee Signals Survey , combined  with their survey responses \non satisfaction with the engineering systems .  \n \nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference -in-differences \nestimate (the change for the adopters minus the change for the non -\nadopters) was ( -2, 4.1), suggesting that Copilot did not have a \nsignificant effect on employee satisfaction with the engineerin g \nsystems. In addition to not finding a statistically significant \ndifference, the study suggests that the true difference is less than a \n4pt change, which is not considered substantial since the NSAT \nscale can range from 0 to 200 and the average moves arou nd a few \npoints from survey wave to survey wave. This is perhaps \nunsurprising since coding is just a part of what constitutes an \nengineering system for most developers. For example, a prior study \nfound developers only spend 21% of their time writing code, with \nthe other time spent doing things like reviewing code, attending \nmeetings, doing email , and reading technical websites (Meyer et al. \n2017). Satisfaction may have been driven primarily by the other \ntools developers used. The lack of effect could also b e because \nsome of the users may have tried  GitHub Copilot , but not used it  \nregularly or they lacked training or manager support for use .   \nA Selection of New Lab Studies  \nWhile the above research focuses on the use of generative AI  in the \nwild, we are also exploring in a lab setting some of the important \ntrends that real-world use highlights .
