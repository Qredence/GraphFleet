One hypothesis \nis this is an early sign of the writing and creation assistance that \nCopilot provides making it easier to produce  and revise  output. \nAlternatively, people may be using some of the time they save with \nCopilot to do additional document creation and editing.   \n This study is still under way , and researchers are planning to \nexplore additional outcomes (e.g., amount of time spent per \ndocument ) as well as  spillovers and team effects  (e.g., the impact \nof a worker’s collaborators having Copilot). This study is limited \nby its focus on work processes. That is, though telemetry can \nprovide an objective measure of activity, th ere is not a direct \nmapping between the observed outcomes (number of documents, \nemails, etc) and productivity , performance or business outcomes . \nMoreover , to preserve privacy, the study observes  activity, not the \ncontent created, so it cannot study quality or how well output aligns \nwith people’s goals or intents.  \nWork Trend Index Survey  \nMore study details available in AI at Work Is Here. Now Comes the \nHard Part  (Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024)  \nTo understand the impact of generative AI on workplace \nproductivity and satisfaction, Microsoft conducted the 2024 Work \nTrend Index Survey.

The survey aimed \nto capture user sentiments and experiences with generative AI \nbroadly as opposed to focusing on any specific generative AI tool \nsuch as Copilot.  \n \nOne key finding from the survey is the widespread use of \nunsanctioned AI tools among employees. The survey revealed that, \nof respondents who used AI, 78% used  at least some AI tools not \nprovided by their organization.
