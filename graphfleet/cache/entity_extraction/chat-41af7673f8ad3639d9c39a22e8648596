In contrast with related work that exploits the structured retrieval\nand traversal affordances of graph indexes (subsection 4.2), we focus on a previously unexplored\nquality of graphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability of com-\nmunity detection algorithms to partition graphs into modular communities of closely-related nodes\n(e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al., 2008; Leiden, Traag et al., 2019). LLM-generated summaries of these\n20 1 2 30100002000030000\nNumber of gleanings performedEntity references detected600 chunk size\n1200 chunk size\n2400 chunk size\nFigure 2: How the entity references detected in the HotPotQA dataset (Yang et al., 2018)\nvaries with chunk size and gleanings for our generic entity extraction prompt with gpt-4-turbo .\ncommunity descriptions provide complete coverage of the underlying graph index and the input doc-\numents it represents. Query-focused summarization of an entire corpus is then made possible using\na map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently\nand in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.\nTo evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-\nmaking questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-\ncast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-\nsity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and\nthemes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries\nused to answer queries, as well as compare to na ¨ıve RAG and global map-reduce summarization\nof source texts. We show that all global approaches outperform na ¨ıve RAG on comprehensiveness\nand diversity, and that Graph RAG with intermediate- and low-level community summaries shows\nfavorable performance over source text summarization on these same metrics, at lower token costs.\n2 Graph RAG Approach & Pipeline\nWe now unpack the high-level data flow of the Graph RAG approach (Figure 1) and pipeline, de-\nscribing key design parameters\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
