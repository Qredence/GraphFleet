This highlights a significant \nphenomenon where many employees turn to external AI resources \nto meet their needs.  \n \nAdditionally, a  significant focus of the Work Trend Index data \nanalyses is “AI Power Users ,” which researchers defined as \nindividuals reporting being familiar with generative AI, using it at \nwork at least several times a week, and saving more than 30 minutes \na day by using it . Overall, 29% of respondents who used AI fell into \nthis bucket. Power users had noticeably lower use of unsanctioned \nAI (66% vs . the non-power user average of 83%, p<.05) . \n \nResearchers sought to understand which factors from the survey \nwere most predictive of the power user classification; they focused \non several survey questions categorized into three areas:  \n• Actions: Actions related to generative AI at work.  \n• Methods: Methods of AI usage.  \n• Outcomes: Feelings or outcomes related to respondent AI \nusage. \n \nThe survey responses were analyzed to build a model identifying \nthe key predictors of AI power user classification. The data \npreparation and modeling process included addressing class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over -sampling Technique \n(SMOTE) and evaluating model performance through cross -\nvalidation. Researchers implemented two predictive models: \nRandom Forest and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest \nmodel outperformed Log istic Regression with an accuracy of 0.744 \nand a ROC -AUC score of 0.737,  compared to Logistic Regression's \naccuracy of 0.657 and ROC -AUC score of 0.695. Consequently, \nthe Random Forest model was trained on the entire dataset to \npinpoint the key predictors of AI power usage.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 2, regular experimentation with AI emerged as \nthe most significant predictor of AI power usage classification. This \nfactor was a stronger predictor of power user classification than \nother AI specific methods, actions, or outcomes. The imp ortance \nscore, measured by a Random Forest statistical model, should be \ninterpreted relatively, as it shows how much each feature helps in \npredicting AI power usage compared to others. Higher scores \nindicate greater importance. In this analysis, scores ran ge from 361 \nto 882, highlighting the significant factors influencing AI power \nuser classification within this dataset and model.  \n \nAs with all surveys of this type\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
