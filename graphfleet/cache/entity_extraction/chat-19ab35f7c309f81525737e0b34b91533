In our pipeline, we use Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) on account of\nits ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently (Figure 3).\nEach level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a\nmutually-exclusive, collective-exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization.\n2.5 Graph Communities \u2192Community Summaries\nThe next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using\na method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in\ntheir own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may\nthemselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question. For example, a user\nmay scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then\nfollow links to the reports at the lower level that provide more details for each of the subtopics. Here,\nhowever, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\nCommunity summaries are generated in the following way:\n4(a) Root communities at level 0 (b) Sub-communities at level 1\nFigure 3: Graph communities detected using the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) over the\nMultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024) dataset as indexed. Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n\u2022Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covariates, and the edge itself.\n\u2022Higher-level communities . If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the con-\ntext window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries\nwithin the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element\nsummary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their\nassociated element summaries (longer) until fit within the context window is achieved.\n2.6 Community Summaries \u2192Community Answers \u2192Global Answer\nGiven a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate\na final answer in a multi-stage process. The hierarchical nature of the community structure also\nmeans that questions can be answered using the community summaries from different levels, raising\nthe question of whether a particular level in the hierarchical community structure offers the best\nbalance of summary detail and scope for general sensemaking questions (evaluated in section 3).\nFor a given community level, the global answer to any user query is generated as follows:\n\u2022Prepare community summaries . Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided\ninto chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed\nacross chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost) in a single context window.\n\u2022Map community answers . Generate intermediate answers in parallel, one for each chunk.\nThe LLM is also asked to generate a score between 0-100 indicating how helpful the gen-\nerated answer is in answering the target question. Answers with score 0 are filtered out.\n\u2022Reduce to global answer . Intermediate community answers are sorted in descending order\nof helpfulness score and iteratively added into a new context window until the token limit\nis reached. This final context is used to generate the global answer returned to the user.\n5Dataset Example activity framing and generation of global sensemaking questions\nPodcast\ntranscriptsUser : A tech journalist looking for insights and trends in the tech industry\nTask: Understanding how tech leaders view the role of policy and regulation\nQuestions :\n1.

How can educators use the dataset to highlight the importance of health literacy?\nTable 1: Examples of potential users, tasks, and questions generated by the LLM based on short\ndescriptions of the target datasets. Questions target global understanding rather than specific details.\n3 Evaluation\n3.1 Datasets\nWe selected two datasets in the one million token range, each equivalent to about 10 novels of text\nand representative of the kind of corpora that users may encounter in their real world activities:\n\u2022Podcast transcripts . Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,\nMicrosoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669\n\u00d7600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( \u223c1 million tokens).\n\u2022News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September\n2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,\ntechnology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 \u00d7\n600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( \u223c1.7 million tokens).\n3.2 Queries\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\nthe associated question sets target explicit fact retrieval rather than summarization for the purpose\nof data sensemaking, i.e., the process though which people inspect, engage with, and contextualize\ndata within the broader scope of real-world activities (Koesten et al., 2021). Similarly, methods for\nextracting latent summarization queries from source texts also exist (Xu and Lapata, 2021), but such\nextracted questions can target details that betray prior knowledge of the texts.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for more global sensemaking tasks, we need questions\nthat convey only a high-level understanding of dataset contents, and not the details of specific texts.\nWe used an activity-centered approach to automate the generation of such questions: given a short\ndescription of a dataset, we asked the LLM to identify Npotential users and Ntasks per user,\nthen for each (user, task) combination, we asked the LLM to generate Nquestions that require\nunderstanding of the entire corpus. For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n63.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C0,C1,C2,C3), a text summarization method applying our map-reduce approach\ndirectly to source texts ( TS), and a na \u00a8\u0131ve \u201csemantic search\u201d RAG approach ( SS):\n\u2022CO. Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.\n\u2022C1. Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities\nof C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected down.\n\u2022C2. Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-\ncommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected down.\n\u2022C3. Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These\nare sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected down.\n\u2022TS. The same method as in subsection 2.6, except source texts (rather than community\nsummaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.\n\u2022SS. An implementation of na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the\navailable context window until the specified token limit is reached.\nThe size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across\nall six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context\ninformation used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.\nThe graph index supporting conditions C0-C3was created using our generic prompts for entity and\nrelationship extraction only, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the\ndata. The graph indexing process used a context window size of 600 tokens with 1 gleaning for the\nPodcast dataset and 0 gleanings for the News dataset.\n3.4 Metrics\nLLMs have been shown to be good evaluators of natural language generation, achieving state-of-\nthe-art or competitive results compared against human judgements (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al.,\n2024). While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are\nknown, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in a reference-\nfree style (Wang et al., 2023a) as well as in head-to-head comparison of competing outputs (LLM-\nas-a-judge, Zheng et al., 2024). LLMs have also shown promise at evaluating the performance of\nconventional RAG systems, automatically evaluating qualities like context relevance, faithfulness,\nand answer relevance (RAGAS, Es et al., 2023).\nGiven the multi-stage nature of our Graph RAG mechanism, the multiple conditions we wanted to\ncompare, and the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we\ndecided to adopt a head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator. We selected three\ntarget metrics capturing qualities that are desirable for sensemaking activities, as well as a control\nmetric (directness) used as a indicator of validity. Since directness is effectively in opposition to\ncomprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four metrics.\nOur head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\n\u2022Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and\ndetails of the question?\n\u2022Diversity . How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights\non the question?\n\u2022Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed\njudgements about the topic?\n\u2022Directness . How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and\nasked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner\nif one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible.\nTo account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.\nTable 2 shows an example of LLM-generated assessment.\n7Question Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\nGraph\nRAGOverview of Prominent Public Figures in Entertainment\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and\ndigital media. Certain public figures stand out due to their significant contributions and influence\nacross these sectors. The following summary highlights key individuals who are repeatedly\nmentioned in various entertainment articles, reflecting their impact and presence within the industry.\nActors and Directors [...]Public Figures in Controversy [...]Musicians and Executives [...]\nAthletes and Coaches [...]Influencers and Entrepreneurs [...]\nThe repeated mention of these figures in entertainment articles signifies their ongoing relevance and\nthe public\u2019s interest in their work. Their influence spans across various aspects of entertainment, from\nshaping cultural narratives in film and television to driving trends in music and digital media. These\nindividuals not only contribute to their respective fields but also influence the broader cultural\nlandscape, often becoming central figures in social discussions and public discourse.\nNa\u00a8\u0131ve\nRAGPublic figures who are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles include Taylor\nSwift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. These individuals have been highlighted\nfor various reasons, ranging from their professional achievements to their personal lives.\nTaylor Swift [...]Travis Kelce [...]Britney Spears [...]Justin Timberlake [...]\nThese figures are frequently covered due to their high-profile status and the public\u2019s interest in their\ncareers and personal lives. Their activities, whether in music, sports, or personal relationships, have\nsignificant cultural and economic impacts, as evidenced by the media coverage and public reactions.\nLLM\nDecisionComprehensiveness: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of public figures from a\nwider range of entertainment sectors, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital\nmedia. It also includes specific examples of their contributions and the impact they have on their\nrespective fields, as well as mentions of controversies and their implications. Answer 2, while\ndetailed in its coverage of a few individuals, is limited to a smaller number of public figures and\nfocuses primarily on their personal lives and relationships rather than a broad spectrum of their\nprofessional influence across the entertainment industry.\nDiversity: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "=\"gpt-4o\"", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
