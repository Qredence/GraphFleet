Self-win rates were not computed but\nare shown as the expected 50% for reference. All Graph RAG conditions outperformed na ¨ıve RAG\non comprehensiveness and diversity. Conditions C1-C3 also showed slight improvements in answer\ncomprehensiveness and diversity over TS (global text summarization without a graph index).\n3.5 Configuration\nThe effect of context window size on any particular task is unclear, especially for models like\ngpt-4-turbo with a large context size of 128k tokens. Given the potential for information to\nbe “lost in the middle” of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to ex-\nplore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and\nmetrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## \n(\"entity\"<|>HEAD-TO-HEAD WIN RATE PERCENTAGES<|>METRIC, DATA<|>The percentages indicating the win rates of one condition over another across two datasets, four metrics, and 125 questions per comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH RAG<|>TECHNOLOGY, METHOD<|>A method that uses a graph index to improve comprehensiveness and diversity in answers compared to naive RAG)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAIVE RAG<|>TECHNOLOGY, METHOD<|>A basic method of retrieval-augmented generation without using a graph index)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDITIONS C1-C3<|>EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION<|>Specific experimental conditions that showed slight improvements in answer comprehensiveness and diversity over TS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TS<|>EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION<|>Global text summarization without a graph index)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE<|>PARAMETER, CONFIGURATION<|>The size of the context window used in a model, tested at 8k, 16k, 32k, and 64k tokens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4-TURBO<|>TECHNOLOGY, MODEL<|>A language model with a large context size of 128k tokens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPREHENSIVENESS<|>METRIC, CRITERION<|>A metric used to evaluate the completeness of answers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVERSITY<|>METRIC, CRITERION<|>A metric used to evaluate the variety in answers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPOWERMENT<|>METRIC, CRITERION<|>A metric used to evaluate the degree to which answers enable or empower users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASELINE CONDITION (SS)<|>EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION<|>The standard condition used as a reference point in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KURATOV ET AL., 2024<|>DOCUMENT, PUBLICATION<|>A reference to a study exploring the effects of context window size on information retention in long contexts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIU ET AL., 2023<|>DOCUMENT, PUBLICATION<|>A reference to a study exploring the effects of context window size on information retention in long contexts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE 8K<|>PARAMETER, CONFIGURATION<|>The smallest context window size tested, which performed best on comprehensiveness and comparably on diversity and empowerment)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAD-TO-HEAD WIN RATE PERCENTAGES<|>GRAPH RAG<|>Graph RAG conditions outperformed naive RAG on comprehensiveness and diversity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAD-TO-HEAD WIN RATE PERCENTAGES<|>NAIVE RAG<|>Graph RAG conditions outperformed naive RAG on comprehensiveness and diversity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDITIONS C1-C3<|>TS<|>Conditions C1-C3 showed slight improvements in answer comprehensiveness and diversity over TS<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE<|>GPT-4-TURBO<|>GPT-4-Turbo has a large context size of 128k tokens, which is relevant to the study of context window size<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE<|>KURATOV ET AL., 2024<|>Kuratov et al., 2024, explored the effects of context window size on information retention<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE<|>LIU ET AL., 2023<|>Liu et al., 2023, explored the effects of context window size on information retention<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE 8K<|>COMPREHENSIVENESS<|>The 8k context window size performed best on comprehensiveness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE 8K<|>DIVERSITY<|>The 8k context window size performed comparably on diversity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE 8K<|>EMPOWERMENT<|>The 8k context window size performed comparably on empowerment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BASELINE CONDITION (SS)<|>CONTEXT WINDOW SIZE 8K<|>The 8k context window size was used for the final evaluation in the baseline condition<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
