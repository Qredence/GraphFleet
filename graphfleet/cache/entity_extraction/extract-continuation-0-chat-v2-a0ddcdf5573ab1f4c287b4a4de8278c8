There are \nseveral potential explanations for these effects, deserving of study. \nPeople may enjoy the experience or be excited by the pursuit of the \n‘answer’ with Copilot, which can reduce or speed perceptions of \ntime (Nak amura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002; Gable and Poole \n2012). Copilot may also make time appear to go faster as people \nfind it easier to extract and process information (Block et al. 2018; \nMatthews and Meck 2016) , and as people gain experience with \nCopilot or use more Copilot apps they may perceive increased time \nsavings due to increased ease of use.  \n \nAn important  limitation of the above research and much of the \nliterature on AI and productivity  is the near total focus on individual \nwork. The large Early Access Program Telemetry Study described \nabove has some preliminary results on document collaboration, and \nthe researchers are exploring extending their analysis to consider \nhow Copilot affects collaboration networks more broadly, \nincluding  Outlook and Teams connections. However, given that \nmuch of the information  work people do is collaborative , it will be  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n10 \n important to further foreground the study of AI’s impact on teams \nand organizations  going forward . Additional research is required to \nunderstand AI’s impact on cross-functional knowledge and \ncooperation , the social cohesion of teams , and the way information \nflows across organizations , all of which have implications for \ngrowth, productivity and innovation .  \n5 CONCLUSION  \nThis report provides an overview of the findings from a set of new \nMicrosoft studies that examine the impact of generative AI  on \ninformation work. It is our second report on the topic, and while the \nfirst (Cambon et al. 2023)  focused on lab studies, this one focuses \non the application  of generative AI  in real-world workplace s. \nAcross all of the studies discussed, t he results suggest that the \npositive productivity effects that have been  observed in a lab setting \nare beginning  to manifest in real -world work. These gains appear \nto vary contextually (e.g., by role or usage), and these variations \nindicate there are ways for individuals, organizations, and tool \nproviders to incorporate generative AI in
