This demonstrates\n7Technical Report\nthat although the ensemble does not guarantee superior performance in every instance, it effectively\nenhances result stability and reliability across varied runs.\n3.5 D ISCUSSION\nIn this section, we will explore some insights gained from the development of Sibyl . We hope that\nthese insights can inspire future LLM-based agent work with more powerful reasoning capabilities.\nChallenges in Complex Reasoning Complex reasoning in real-world applications is inherently\nchallenging due to the high risk of error propagation. Even with an 80% accuracy rate at each\nstep, the probability of maintaining this accuracy consistently across 20 steps plummets to merely\naround 1%. This exponential increase in error risk highlights the critical nature of maintaining high\naccuracy at every step in reasoning. Furthermore, excessive errors can cause a series of retries which\nconsume significant portions of the context, submerge useful information and hamper the problem-\nsolving process.\nStrategic Approaches to Mitigating Errors The decomposition of complex reasoning into sim-\npler, manageable substeps is vital, as improving the success rate of each step can significantly mit-\nigate error propagation. Selective compression of historical information plays a key role here, as\nmost of the data accumulated during web navigation and previous interactions do not directly con-\ntribute to solving the problem at hand. This approach not only streamlines information processing,\nbut also focuses on maintaining only the most pertinent data, enhancing overall system efficiency.\nImportance of Debug-oriented Design A robust debug-oriented design is essential for reduc-\ning debugging costs and facilitating rapid system iteration. By limiting the introduction of state\nand striving for decoupling between components and even individual LLM inference requests, the\nsystem\u2019s maintainability and adaptability are significantly improved. Given that Sibyl follows the\ncombinator pattern, it can be seamlessly integrated as a low-cost enhancement into existing frame-\nworks, easily replacing the vanilla GPT-4 API. This design can make it more flexible in various\nLLM applications.\nOptimizing Tool Usage Considering the aforementioned error propagation in complex reasoning,\noptimizing existing tools is often more crucial than adding new ones. The potential of tools such as\nweb browsers is far from fully realized; current LLM agents do not yet match human capabilities\nin terms of content visibility and operational scope on web platforms. Enhancing these tools to\nfully exploit their capabilities can provide substantial improvements in performance and utility, thus\ndriving forward the sophistication and effectiveness of AI systems in complex environments.\n4 R ELATED WORK\nThe integration of LLMs into autonomous agents marks a significant advancement in the field of\nartificial intelligence. These agents, capable of sensing their environment, making decisions and\ntaking actions, are at the forefront of pushing AI towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) (Xi\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). These agents, often referred to as LLM-based agents, are increas-\ningly prevalent across a variety of domains, demonstrating the potential of LLM applications in\ncomplex scenarios.\nMost LLM-based agents are designed for specific applications, highlighting their adaptability but\nalso suffering from a potential limitation in versatility. These applications include mathmatical\nproblem solving (Gou et al., 2023; Swan et al., 2023), coding (Yang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024),\nrole-playing (Shao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023), and social simulation (Park et al., 2023; Gao et al.,\n2023). To take a step further towards general purpose LLM-based agents that are capable of various\ngeneral tasks, open-source communities have developed some LLM-based agent framework, such\nas Langchain (Chase, 2022), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023) and AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023). Equipped\nwith tools and structured frameworks, these agents can competently handle relatively straightfor-\nward tasks with human-like capabilities. However, their proficiency in tackling complex real-world\nchallenges remains comparatively limited. This gap indicates the need for further enhancements in\ngeneral-purpose LLM-based agents to address more intricate problems effectively.\n8Technical Report\n5 C ONCLUSION\nWe introduce Sibyl , an agent framework designed to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in complex\nreasoning tasks. Through the integration of modular design and a global workspace for information\nsharing and collaboration, Sibyl aims to facilitate the transition of LLM-based agents from rapid and\nintuitive System-1 thinking to slow and delibrate System-2 thinking. Our experimental results on\nthe GAIA benchmark show that the Sibyl agent instantiated by GPT-4 outperforms existing state-of-\nthe-art solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We hope that Sibyl\ncan contribute to the promotion of LLM applications to have better capabilities in handling complex\nreal-world tasks.\nREFERENCES\nJosh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Ale-\nman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.
