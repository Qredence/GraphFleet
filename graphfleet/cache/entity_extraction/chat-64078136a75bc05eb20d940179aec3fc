However, these agents\nstill exhibit shortcomings in long-term reasoning and under-use the potential of\nexisting tools, leading to noticeable deficiencies in complex real-world reasoning\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Sibyl , a simple yet power-\nful LLM-based agent framework designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks by\nefficiently leveraging a minimal set of tools. Drawing inspiration from Global\nWorkspace Theory ,Sibyl incorporates a global workspace to enhance the manage-\nment and sharing of knowledge and conversation history throughout the system.\nFurthermore, guided by Society of Mind Theory ,Sibyl implements a multi-agent\ndebate-based jury to self-refine the final answers, ensuring a comprehensive and\nbalanced approach. This approach aims to reduce system complexity while ex-\npanding the scope of problems solvable\u2014from matters typically resolved by hu-\nmans in minutes to those requiring hours or even days, thus facilitating a shift\nfrom System-1 to System-2 thinking. Sibyl has been designed with a focus on\nscalability and ease of debugging by incorporating the concept of reentrancy from\nfunctional programming from its inception, with the aim of seamless and low\neffort integration in other LLM applications to improve capabilities. Our experi-\nmental results on the GAIA benchmark test set reveal that the Sibyl agent instan-\ntiated with GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of\n34.55%, compared to other agents based on GPT-4. We hope that Sibyl can in-\nspire more reliable and reusable LLM-based agent solutions to address complex\nreal-world reasoning tasks.1\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of human-computer interaction\n(HCI) by offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text.\nLLM-based agents, which are systems designed to harness these models, effectively orchestrate\nLLM capabilities to address complex tasks (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). These agents lever-\nage human-designed frameworks that utilize the inherent knowledge within LLMs, often employing\nstructured workflows that maximize the potential of in-context learning and zero-shot capabilities.\nSuch strategies allow these agents to engage in sophisticated dialogues and problem-solving sce-\nnarios that mirror human cognitive processes (Sumers et al., 2023). By incorporating prior human\nknowledge into the workflow, LLM-based agents can process and utilize information with a level of\nproficiency that was previously unattainable.\nDespite their abilities, LLM-based agents are often limited by their inability to engage in complex\nquestions of reasoning in real-world scenarios, where the number of reasoning steps can be nu-\nmerous (Mialon et al., 2023). While LLMs excel in simpler, quick-answer scenarios, they struggle\n\u2217Equal Contributions.\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/Ag2S1/Sibyl-System .\n1arXiv:2407.10718v2  [cs.AI]  16 Jul 2024Technical Report\nsignificantly when tasks demand lengthy, complex reasoning chains, often resulting in error prop-\nagation and a steep decline in accuracy. To address these complex real-world problems, existing\nsystems are often intricately designed, leading to complexity that makes them difficult to evolve or\noptimize. This complexity not only impedes their practical deployment, but also restricts their adapt-\nability and scalability in various LLM applications, which underscores the need for an approach that\nhas simple design while improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents.\nFurthermore, long-context management also remains a significant hurdle in LLM applications. The\ncollection of abundant external information (e.g, computation output and error messages during\ncoding, or intricate web content) creates a high demand for managing long context sizes effectively\nwithin the LLM\u2019s processing capabilities. However, Hsieh et al. (2024) found that there exists a\nnotable gap between the claimed length (the designed maximum context size a model can handle)\nand the effective length (the maximum context size a model can effectively manage) that LLMs\ncan process. On the other hand, the challenge of long contexts is further compounded by the need\nto integrate information from various sources and data formats, often leading to \u201ccontext dilution\u201d\nproblem where valuable information is overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data (Xu et al., 2023;\nShi et al., 2024). Effective context management is crucial to ensure that LLMs can maintain focus\non relevant information without being sidetracked by less pertinent details. As such, addressing\nthis gap is not just about increasing the raw capacity of models to handle more data but also about\nimproving their ability to discern and prioritize information that is most critical for the task at hand.\nTo address the identified limitations in long-term reasoning and system complexity, we introduce\nSibyl , a simple yet powerful LLM-based agent framework. The system is compartmentalized into\nfour main modules: tool planner, external information acquisition channel, a jury based on multi-\nagent debate and a global workspace. Specifically, we introduce an external information acquisition\nchannel to receive and process external information from selected tools. To efficiently compress\nthe received information, we integrate the concept of dialogue states from task-oriented dialogue\nsystems (Budzianowski et al., 2018; Quan et al., 2020; Moradshahi et al., 2023) into the channel\nand design a representation language for the compressed information. This adaptation allows for\nthe selective compression of external information, focusing only on incremental details pertinent to\nsolving problems, which diverges from the traditional method of simply appending external infor-\nmation to the conversational history. By doing so, it not only elevates the quality and relevance of\nthe information processed by LLMs but also conserves context length, allowing for more extended\nsteps in reasoning. In addition, we design a global workspace inspired by the Global Workspace\nTheory (Baars, 1993; 2005) that facilitates seamless information sharing among the modules, and\na multi-agent debate-based jury under the guidance of Society of Mind Theory (Minsky, 1988) that\nencourages self-refinement before the final response.\nThe inner design of Sibyl is inspired by functional programming principles, emphasizing reusability\nand statelessness between operations. This is realized through the use of QA functions instead of\ndialogues in internal LLM inference requests, allowing for each LLM inference to operate inde-\npendently without the need to maintain a persistent state. By reducing inner dependency on LLM\nrequests and maintaining a simple structure, we hope that Sibyl can be easily reused to facilitate and\ninspire other LLM-based applications to improve their reasoning capabilities and achieve the shift\nfrom System-1 (rapid and intuitive) to System-2 (slow and delibrate) thinking.\nWe evaluated the Sibyl agent instantiated by GPT-4o API (text only) in the GAIA benchmark test\nset, which is carefully designed to probe the depth and robustness of reasoning through a diverse\nset of real-world questions (Mialon et al., 2023). Sibyl agent achieves an impressive average score\nof 34.55% on the GAIA test set, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method based on Au-\ntoGen (Wu et al., 2023) and demonstrating its superior reasoning capabilities. In contrast, widely\nused systems like AutoGPT-4 (Gravitas, 2023) achieve only an 5% average score. Notably, Sibyl\nagent secures scores of 32.7% and 16.33% in the more challenging level 2 and level 3 scenarios of\nGAIA, respectively. These results represent significant relative improvements of 13% and 12% over\nthe prior state-of-the-art method, underscoring Sibyl \u2019s proficiency in managing intricate, long-term\nreasoning tasks.\nOur contributions are as follows:\n2Technical Report\nUserQueryExternalInformationAcquisitionChannelToolPlanner\nGlobalWorkspaceMulti-agentDebate-basedJury\nResponse\nFigure 1: The overall pipeline of Sibyl framework.\n\u2022 We propose Sibyl , a simple and powerful LLM-based agent framework that embodies a de-\nsign philosophy centered on simplicity, modularity, and reusability by promoting stateless\ninteractions during inference time, which facilitates ease of debugging and enhancement.\n\u2022 We develop an external information acquisition channel accompanied by a representation\nlanguage specifically tailored to efficiently gather and selectively compress external infor-\nmation. Drawing inspiration from Global Workspace Theory andSociety of Mind Theory ,\nwe also introduce a global workspace that facilitates effective information sharing across\nmodules, and a multi-agent debate-based jury that promotes self-reflection.\n\u2022 The experimental results on the GAIA benchmark test set demonstrate that the Sibyl agent\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the challenging Level 2 and Level\n3 scenarios, which underscores the improvement of Sibyl in solving complex reasoning\ntasks.\n2 T HESIBYL FRAMEWORK\nIn this section, we provide a overview of the Sibyl framework, focusing on its design philosophy\nand fundamental modules. As shown in Figure 1, given a user query, Sibyl starts with the tool\nplanner which aims to select appropriate tools, functions, and parameters tailored to each specific\nsubtask. Then, we design an external information acquisition channel to call the tools and selectively\ncompress the external information returned by tool execution. Inspired by Society of Mind Theory ,\nwe incorporate a multi-agent debate-based jury to achieve self-correction and a global workspace\nto seamlessly share information and enable effective collaboration across all modules. The prompts\nfor each module are described in Appendix C.\n2.1 D ESIGN PHILOSOPHY\nTheSibyl framework is constructed around a core design philosophy that focuses on reducing com-\nplexity while enhancing the functional capabilities of LLM-based agents. This philosophy is imple-\nmented through several strategic approaches to restructure LLM operations.\nHuman-oriented Browser Interface Instead of Retrieval Augmented Generation In conven-\ntional LLM-based agent setups, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to significant\ninformation loss due to the limitation of retrieval process, which can lose the sequential informa-\ntion and connection of chunks in long text and have to trade off between information precision and\nrecall. Retrieving information at a coarse level yields a wider range of data but with less preci-\nsion, while a fine-level retrieval approach ensures a more detailed dataset, albeit sacrificing speed.\nInspired by the success of WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), Sibyl addresses this by adopting a human-\noriented browser interface, shifting away from RAG\u2019s constraints towards a more intuitive, human-\nlike method of information retrieval. This form of information gathering is crucial as it retains the\nrelational dynamics of the text, preserving more context and depth in the data accessed by the agent.\nQuestion Answering Function Instead of Dialogues Recent agent frameworks such as AutoGen\n(Wu et al., 2023) utilize dialogue as the primary mode of communication between different modules.\nThis design is intended to mimic human conversational patterns, making the interaction more natural\n3Technical Report\nand user-friendly. However, dialogues are stateful and can create complex dependencies among\nvarious LLM inference calls within a session, complicating the debugging and prompt engineering\nprocesses significantly. Sibyl replaces this with a stateless, reentrant QA function that decouples\nindividual LLM inference requests. This transformation significantly simplifies the architecture\nof the system, facilitating easier maintenance and modification while allowing each component to\noperate independently without legacy constraints from previous interactions.\nLess Universal Tools Instead of More Specialized Tools Sibyl centralizes its functionalities\naround two primary tools: the Web browser and Python environments. It aligns the browser\u2019s inter-\nface more closely with human interaction modes, such as using page navigation commands (page\ndown/up), click, and search shortcuts (ctrl+f, ctrl+g). This approach moves away from reliance\nsolely on web crawlers and full-page content parsing, aiming for a more selective and relevant data\ninteraction method that mimics human web usage patterns.\nFrom System-1 to System-2 Thinking TheSibyl framework places a strong emphasis on enhanc-\ning capabilities for long-term memory, planning, and error correction\u2013elements vital for complex,\nlong-distance reasoning.\n\u2022Shared Long-term Memory as First-class Citizen: Sibyl incorporates a global workspace\nthat all modules share, which is designed from the ground up and stores information with\nan incremental state-based representation language. This language selectively compresses\npast events, adding only information increments relevant to problem solving, rather than\nsimply appending all incoming data.\n\u2022Planning and Self-correction: Sibyl summarizes the outcomes from its tools, and plans\nsubsequent steps based on the assessment of current progress. This involves strategic think-\ning about which pieces of information are necessary and how they should be processed\nmoving forward. In addition, Sibyl introduces a \u201cJury\u201d mechanism, which utilizes a multi-\nagent debate format for self-critique and correction. This process allows the model to\nutilize the information stored in the global workspace efficiently to refine responses and\nensure accurate problem solving.\nThrough these principles, Sibyl aims to advance the development of LLM-based agents, shifting to-\nwards a model that is not only more aligned with human cognitive processes but also more adaptable\nand capable of handling the complexities of real-world\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "=\"gpt-4o\"", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
