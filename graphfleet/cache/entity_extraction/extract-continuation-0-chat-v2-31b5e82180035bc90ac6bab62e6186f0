In this study, 40 Microsoft employees who volunteered for \nthe study created a sales report in Word based on data in an Excel \nspreadsheet (using a sample report for reference). Half of the \nparticipants had access to Copilot and half did not. In addition to \nmeasuring time and accuracy, the study asked participants about Generative AI in Real -World Workplaces  Microsoft Technical Report  \n \n9 \n how demanding, hard, stressful, and rushed the task was, and the \nstudy administered a Stroop test as a measure of participants’ \ncognitive load (Scarpina and Tagini 2017). A Stroop test measures \nparticipants response times and error rates in a quick classif ication \ntask to try to measure the cognitive load they experienced prior to \nthe test.  \n \nParticipants with Copilot reported the task was less mentally \ndemanding on average (30 out of 100) than the control group (55 \nout of 100). The improvements for perceived stress and difficulty \nwere similar, with an even larger difference (28 vs. 67 out of 1 00) \nfor how rushed the task felt. All reported differences have t -test \nwith p<.05. It seems that , contrary to the concerns raised in the \nprevious section, in this case the direct help from Copilot counter -\nbalanced or outweighed any increase in metacognitiv e load. \nInterestingly, the researchers did not find a difference in the \naverage Stroop score. It is possible that while Copilot made the task \nfeel easier and more enjoyable, it did not affect participants’ ability \nto do the subsequent task. Alternatively, there ma y have been a \nsmall effect on the Stroop score that the study did not have the \nstatistical power to detect, or the Stroop score did not capture the \neffects observed by the participants in the survey.   \n4 DISCUSSION  \nWe now look across the studies discussed individual ly in this report  \nto further explore common themes.
