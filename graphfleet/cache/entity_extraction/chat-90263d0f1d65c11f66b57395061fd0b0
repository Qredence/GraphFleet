The authors hypothesized that variations in developers’ \nproblem-solving approaches and workstyles would significantly \ninfluence their interactions with Copilot, thereby affecting their \nconfidence and productivity outcomes.  \n \nTo explore this hypothesis, the authors employed the GenderMag \nsurvey (Burnett et al. 2016; Anderson et al . 2024), a tool \nspecifically designed to investigate the impact of differences in \npeople’s problem -solving styles when working with technology. \nThis survey was used along with additional questions about \nconfidence in Copilot prompting overall and for different \nscenarios.  A third-party recruiting firm recruited participants who \nworked in programing roles, had done so for at least six months, \nand used Git Hub Copilot at work. The survey was sent to 250 \npeople, yielding 212 usable responses.  To analyze the data, \nresearchers ran a regression model to measure the extent to which \nyears of experience, time using Copilot, and each GenderMag trait, \n(Computer self -efficacy, risk -aversion, info -processing style, \nmotivation for technology use, and learning style ), explained \nrespondents’ confidence in each scenario.   \n \nThe study found that the duration for which developers have been \nusing GitHub Copilot was the most significant factor explaining \ntheir prompting confidence. They also found that confidence in \nprompting is inversely related to the number of years of \nprofessional software development experience. While this may \nseem counterintuitive, it could be because they are more familiar \nwith or attached to existing workflows or because more \nexperience d developer s are better able  to spot errors and \ninaccuracies in Copilot  responses. If they attribute those errors to \ntheir prompts, it could make them less confident that they can create \nsuccessful prompts.  The analysis also showed that developers with \na comprehensive approach to information processing and \ndevelopers who are motivated to use technology for its own sake \nare also more confident in generating prompts. These findings echo \nthose above suggesting b enefits of usage increase over time.  \nGitHub Copilot and Engineering System Satisfaction  (An-Jen \nTai, Shwetha Srinath , and Re\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
