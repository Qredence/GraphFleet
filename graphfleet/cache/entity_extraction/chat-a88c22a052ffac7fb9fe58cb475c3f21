This limitation affects the agent\u2019s ability to interact\nwith web content in a more natural and efficient manner.\nLearning Mechanisms The present system does not incorporate learning mechanisms to adapt\nand improve from real-world interactions on-the-fly. This may restrict its ability to evolve based on\nnew data or scenarios it encounters.\nD.2 F UTURE DIRECTIONS\nIntegrating Vision Large Language Models Future versions of Sibyl will incorporate vision\nlarge language models to allow the system to handle multimedia content effectively, broadening\nits applicability across various domains where visual data plays a crucial role.\nEnhancing Browser Capabilities There is a pressing need to optimize the browser tool to provide\nfull functionality, mirroring the capabilities available to human users, thereby improving the agent\u2019s\ninteraction with web interfaces.\nDesigning Adaptive Learning Mechanisms In the future version of Sibyl , we plan to introduce\nadaptive learning mechanisms will enable the system to learn from its interactions and experiences,\nthereby progressively improving its problem-solving strategies and effectiveness.\nDeveloping LLMs tailored for Agents Future work will also focus on developing LLMs that\nare specifically optimized for general-purpose AI agents, aiming to enhance their efficiency and\neffectiveness in complex reasoning tasks. This includes gathering and utilizing data specific to long-\ndistance reasoning processes in real-world scenarios and improving the system\u2019s ability to build and\nreuse its tools autonomously.\n17\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "=\"gpt-4o\"", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
