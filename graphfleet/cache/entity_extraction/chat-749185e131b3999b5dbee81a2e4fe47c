Queries are then embedded into the same vector space, with the text\nchunks of the nearest kvectors used as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM’s context window.\nAdvanced RAG systems include pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval strategies designed to over-\ncome the drawbacks of Na ¨ıve RAG, while Modular RAG systems include patterns for iterative and\ndynamic cycles of interleaved retrieval and generation (Gao et al., 2023). Our implementation of\nGraph RAG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears resemblance to further\napproaches, such as generating a hierarchical index of text chunks by clustering the vectors of text\nembeddings (RAPTOR, Sarthi et al., 2024) or generating a “tree of clarifications” to answer mul-\ntiple interpretations of ambiguous questions (Kim et al., 2023). However, none of these iterative or\nhierarchical approaches use the kind of self-generated graph index that enables Graph RAG.\n104.2 Graphs and LLMs\nUse of graphs in connection with LLMs and RAG is a developing research area, with multiple\ndirections already established.
