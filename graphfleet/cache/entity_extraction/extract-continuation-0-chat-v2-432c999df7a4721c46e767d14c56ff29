Collectively , the studies  \nsuggest generative AI is already having positive effects  on real-\nworld productivity and begin to highlight the complexity in these \neffects that emerge from taking a more complete view of work  via \nfield research.  \nAs noted above, m ost previous research in this space relied on lab \nstudies, which b y and large provide insight into just a small subset \nof the tasks people perform as part of their everyday work.  The \ntasks studied in the lab, for example, have tended to require only \ngeneral knowledge and skill s. In contrast, tasks done in the course \nof work often require highly-specific knowledge and skills. The \ncurrent generation of generative AI models have been trained \nprimarily on public data, which means they perform best on the \ntypes of generic tasks used in these lab studies. Although t he gains \nobserved on those tasks in the lab appear to be translating at least \nto some extent to the real-world tasks  that people actually do , it will \nbe important to continue studying AI’s impact as models begin to \nbecome tailored to perform even better within specific \norganizational contexts  or domains. \n \nMore generally, t he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to \nbe those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would \nperform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies \npresented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  \n(Cambon et al. 2023) .

The ability to \nshed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural \ncomplexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies \nof generative AI’s productivity impacts , and
