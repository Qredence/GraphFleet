Given AI ’s impact appears to \nvary by role and function, several of these lab studies explore this, \ndiving more deeply into software development and extending th e \nanalysis to other important roles like sales and security. Further, \nbecause Copilot is deployed globally, we ’re also starting to see \nvariation across languages, and thus presen t research studies \nlooking at AI in multilingual contexts. Finally, the complex trade -\noffs people are starting to make to incorporate AI into their work \npractices suggests the cognitive mechanisms underlying its use are \nimportant to understand, and we share some earl y work in that \nspace as well .  \nComparing the Effect of Different Task Types on Effective Use \nof GitHub Copilot  (Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan ) \nThis study investigated the conditions under which a developer \nmight expect to benefit most from GitHub Copilot. The authors \nrecruited 23 Java developers with at least one year of professional \nexperience and asked them to  perform one of two different tasks. \nHalf worked on a task that involved writing new code using familiar \ncomponents and concepts , and the other half worked on a different \ntask that involved modifying existing  code using unfamiliar \ncomponents and concepts. For each task, h alf of the participants \ncompleted the task using Copilot and the other half did not  use it. \n \nAll participants were allowed to use any online resources they \nwanted, but those in the Copilot group were first given a 10 -minute \noverview of GitHub Copilot and encouraged to use that. Even with \nthese small sample sizes, the researchers found evidence  that the type of task  matters for the impact that Copilot has on the \ndeveloper. With the familiar task Copilot use resulted in 36% time -\nsavings (p<.05) and 48% fewer issues (p=.12). In contrast , no \nsubstantial difference was observed between Copilot and non-\nCopilot groups  for the less familiar task .  \nUnderstanding the Impact Copilot for Security Has for \nSecurity
