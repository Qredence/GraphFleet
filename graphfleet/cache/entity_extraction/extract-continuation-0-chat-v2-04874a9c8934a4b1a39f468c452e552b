The study asked 64 Microsoft sellers to answer both \nmultiple-choice and open -ended questions in a Qualtrics survey \ndesigned to simulate questions that a customer might ask. Sellers \nwere randomly assigned to either have or not have access to the \nchatbot. \n  Jaffe et al. 2024  \n \n8 \n Having the chatbot improved both speed and accuracy. Sellers with \nthe chatbot answered multiple choice questions 3.4 minutes (39%, \np<.05) faster and accuracy improved by 25 percentage points \n(p<.05). In the open -ended questions, speed, accuracy, \ncompletene ss, and suitability ratings all improved 34 -56% (p<.05). \nThese results suggest a positive potential for AI in sales workflows \nof managing customer sales calls, with potential implications for \nrevenue and customer satisfaction outcomes.   \nThe Effect of Copilot in a Multi -lingual Context (Benjamin \nEdelman and Donald Ngwe)  \nAnother important source of variation i s language. Researchers \nexplored Copilot in multilingual contexts, examining how Copilot \ncan facilitate collaboration between colleagues with different \nnative languages.  \n \nFirst, researchers  asked 77 native Japanese speakers to review a \nmeeting recorded in English . Half the participants had to watch and \nlisten to the video. The other half could use Copilot Meeting Recap, \nwhich gave them an AI meeting summary as well as a chatbot to \nanswer questions about the meeting. Then, researchers asked 83 \nother native Japanese speakers to review a similar meeting, \nfollowing the same script, but this time held in Japanese  by native \nJapanese speakers. Again, half of participants had access to \nCopilot.  \n \nFor the meeting in English , participants with Copilot  answered \n16.4% more multiple -choice questions about the meeting correctly, \nand they were more than twice as likely to get a perfect score. \nMoreover , in comparing accuracy between the two scenarios, \npeople listening to a meeting in English with Copilot achieved \n97.5%
