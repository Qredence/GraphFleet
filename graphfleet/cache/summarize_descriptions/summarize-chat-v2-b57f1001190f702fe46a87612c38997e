{"result": "Researchers are individuals conducting comprehensive studies on the usage and benefits of generative AI tools like Copilot in various professional workflows. They are involved in analyzing the impact of these tools on information work in real-world contexts, including job postings and coding activities. Their work includes studying the metacognitive demands of generative AI and understanding its impact on employees. Researchers have analyzed 80,000 randomly selected, de-identified conversations from the consumer version of Copilot in Bing and traditional Bing searches. Additionally, they have conducted lab studies to assess the impact of a licensing chatbot on Microsoft sellers. Through interviews and various studies, researchers aim to understand the broader implications of Copilot and generative AI on productivity and professional environments.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
