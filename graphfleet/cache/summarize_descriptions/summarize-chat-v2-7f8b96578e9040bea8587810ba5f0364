{"result": "GRAPH INDEX is a structured representation of data elements and their relationships, extracted from text chunks using LLM prompts. It is used in Graph RAG to achieve better summarization results and support various graph-related RAG approaches. The graph index supports conditions C0-C3 and is created using generic prompts for entity and relationship extraction, tailored to the domain of the data.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
