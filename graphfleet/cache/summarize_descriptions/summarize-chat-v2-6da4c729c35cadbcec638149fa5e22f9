{"result": "Productivity is a measure of how effectively tasks are completed, often reported as improved by using AI tools like GitHub Copilot. It refers to the efficiency and effectiveness with which tasks and work are completed, typically measured in terms of output per unit of input, time, and accuracy. Studies aim to measure these improvements, particularly focusing on the efficiency and output of developers, which can be significantly impacted by generative AI tools. Users of such tools often report enhanced efficiency and output, although there are concerns about the broader implications of AI on productivity.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
