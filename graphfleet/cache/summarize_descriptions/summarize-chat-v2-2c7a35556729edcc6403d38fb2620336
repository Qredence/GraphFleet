{"result": "WORKFLOWS refer to the comprehensive set of activities involved in completing a job or task, often involving multiple steps and processes. They encompass the sequence of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion. In the context of software development, workflows specifically denote the series of tasks and processes that developers follow in their work, which AI tools like GitHub Copilot could potentially improve by automating repetitive tasks, providing code suggestions, and enhancing overall productivity.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
