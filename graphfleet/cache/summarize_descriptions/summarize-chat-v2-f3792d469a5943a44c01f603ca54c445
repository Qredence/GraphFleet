{"result": "COMPREHENSIVENESS is a metric used to evaluate the quality of generated answers or assessments by measuring how complete, thorough, and detailed they are. It assesses the extent to which an answer covers all relevant aspects of a question, providing a comprehensive view of the topic. This metric is crucial for evaluating the breadth and depth of information provided, ensuring that all aspects and details of the question are addressed. In practical applications, global approaches have achieved win rates between 72-83% for Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles. The Graph RAG approach, specifically defined in subsection 3.4, aims to improve the comprehensiveness of answers by covering all relevant aspects of the data.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
