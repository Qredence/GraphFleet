{"result": "GPT-4-TURBO is a version of the GPT-4 model designed for generic entity extraction prompts. It features a large context size of 128k tokens, making it highly capable of handling extensive and complex text inputs. This enhanced context size allows GPT-4-TURBO to maintain coherence and relevance over longer interactions, which is particularly beneficial in professional workflows that require detailed and accurate information extraction.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
