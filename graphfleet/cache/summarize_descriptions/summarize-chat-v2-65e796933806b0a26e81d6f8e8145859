{"result": "Hoque, E. is an author known for contributions to the field of query-focused abstractive text summarization. In 2020, Hoque, E. co-authored the paper \"Query focused abstractive summarization via incorporating query relevance and transfer learning with transformer models,\" which explores the integration of query relevance and transfer learning using transformer models. Building on this work, in 2022, Hoque, E. co-authored another significant paper titled \"Domain adaptation with pre-trained transformers for query-focused abstractive text summarization,\" which delves into the application of pre-trained transformers for domain adaptation in the context of query-focused summarization. These publications highlight Hoque, E.'s ongoing research and expertise in leveraging advanced AI techniques to enhance text summarization processes.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
