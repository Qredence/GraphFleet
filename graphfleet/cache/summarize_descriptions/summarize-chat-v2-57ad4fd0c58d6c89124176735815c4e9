{"result": "Community summaries are condensed versions of source texts, often created by a group or community, and are used to improve answer comprehensiveness and diversity. These summaries are domain-tailored and generated from different community levels, making them useful for answering queries. They are also generic summaries derived from the graph index, beneficial for various graph-related Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches. Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided into chunks of pre-specified token size to ensure relevant information is distributed across chunks. They include intermediate- and low-level summaries that show favorable performance over source text summarization on certain metrics at lower token costs. These pre-generated summaries for groups of closely-related entities are used to generate partial responses in the Graph RAG approach. Additionally, they serve as report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, aiding in understanding the global structure and semantics of the dataset. Created at different levels of a graph community hierarchy, these summaries are used to evaluate comprehensiveness and diversity. They summarize modular communities within a graph, allowing for independent and parallel query responses, and act as a kind of self-memory for generation-augmented retrieval, facilitating future generation cycles.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
