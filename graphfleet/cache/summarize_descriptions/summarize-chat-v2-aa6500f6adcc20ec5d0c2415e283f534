{"result": "Empowerment is a metric used to evaluate the degree to which generated answers or assessments enable or empower users. It measures how well an answer helps the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic. In the context of evaluating the Graph RAG approach, as defined in subsection 3.4, empowerment is a target quality that compares the effectiveness of different summarization and retrieval methods in helping users reach an informed understanding. This metric is also used to assess the effectiveness of an approach, with an average win rate of 51.3%.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
