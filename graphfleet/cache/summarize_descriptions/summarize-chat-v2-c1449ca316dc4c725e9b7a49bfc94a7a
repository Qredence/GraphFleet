{"result": "Burnett, M. is an author known for significant contributions to the field of software inclusiveness and human-AI interaction. In 2016, Burnett, M. authored the paper \"GenderMag: A Method for Evaluating Software's Gender Inclusiveness,\" which focuses on assessing software for gender inclusivity. Additionally, in 2024, Burnett, M. authored another influential paper titled \"Measuring User Experience Inclusivity in Human-AI Interaction via Five User Problem-Solving Styles,\" published in ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems. This work further explores inclusivity by examining user experience in the context of human-AI interactions through various problem-solving styles.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
