{"result": "SOURCE DOCUMENTS are the original texts from which input data is extracted and split into text chunks for further processing. These documents serve as the foundational texts from which information is retrieved, analyzed, and summarized, particularly in the context of the Graph RAG approach. They are essential for ensuring the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the extracted information, forming the basis for subsequent data analysis and summarization tasks.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
