{"result": "GRAPHRAG is a sophisticated system designed to create and reason over knowledge graphs in the NebulaGraph format. It employs a method known as Graph RAG, which integrates knowledge graph generation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS). This combination supports human sensemaking over extensive text corpora, enhancing the ability to extract, organize, and summarize information effectively.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
