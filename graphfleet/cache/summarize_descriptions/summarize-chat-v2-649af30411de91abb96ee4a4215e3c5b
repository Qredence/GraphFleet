{"result": "The STUDY is an ongoing research project designed to measure metacognitive load and the impact of GitHub Copilot on cognitive load. It aims to analyze the benefits and limitations of using Copilot in real-world workplaces, focusing on how AI-augmented tools like Copilot affect task complexity and domain. The research suggests that large language models (LLMs) will bring substantial changes in how people use search-based tools and accomplish knowledge work tasks. The study also examines conversations and searches to understand these impacts. While it shares the common limitations of surveys that rely on self-reports, it is comprehensive in its approach, exploring additional outcomes such as the amount of time spent per document, spillovers, and team effects.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
