{"result": "GitHub Copilot is a generative AI tool that assists software developers with coding tasks. It supports coding activities by suggesting code snippets and completing code, particularly in languages like Python. This AI-powered code completion tool helps developers by generating code suggestions based on the context of their work. GitHub Copilot has been explored in studies such as those by Steven Clarke and Ben Hanrahan, and is mentioned in the paper \"The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity: Evidence from GitHub Copilot.\"", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
