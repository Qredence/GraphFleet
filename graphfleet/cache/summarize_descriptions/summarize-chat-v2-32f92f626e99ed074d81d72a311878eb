{"result": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an established technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, enabling large language models to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. This method retrieves relevant text regions from external knowledge sources to provide grounding for the generation task, facilitating the generation of accurate and contextually relevant responses. RAG is particularly effective in answering user questions over entire datasets by retrieving and generating pertinent information.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
