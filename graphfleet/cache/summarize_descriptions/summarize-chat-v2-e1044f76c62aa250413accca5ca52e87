{"result": "LLM, which stands for Large Language Model, is a type of artificial intelligence used for various natural language processing tasks. These tasks include generating a first draft of job postings, extracting and summarizing information from text, generating intermediate answers and scoring their helpfulness, and creating questions for evaluating datasets. LLMs are capable of generating human-like text based on input data and can handle extensive context windows, although these can be exceeded by external datasets.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research. You are skilled at analyzing the impact and application of generative AI in professional workflows, including software development and multilingual contexts. You are adept at helping people understand the evaluation metrics for AI performance and the integration of AI tools like GitHub Copilot in real-world settings.\nUsing your expertise, you're asked to generate a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, concise description in The primary language of the provided text is \"English.\". Make sure to include information collected from all the descriptions.\nIf the provided descriptions are contradictory, please resolve the contradictions and provide a single, coherent summary.\nMake sure it is written in third person, and include the entity names so we the have full context.\n\nEnrich it as much as you can with relevant information from the nearby text, this is very important.\n\nIf no answer is possible, or the description is empty, only convey information that is provided within the text.\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"LLM\"\nDescription List: [\"LLM refers to a large language model used to generate a first draft of job postings\", \"LLM stands for Large Language Model, a type of AI used for natural language processing tasks\", \"LLM stands for Large Language Model, a type of artificial intelligence used to generate text based on input data\", \"LLM stands for Large Language Model, which is used for extracting and summarizing information from text\", \"Large Language Model used to generate intermediate answers and score their helpfulness\", \"Large Language Model used to generate questions for evaluating datasets\", \"Large Language Model, a type of AI that can generate human-like text based on input data\", \"Large Language Models, which have a context window that can be exceeded by external datasets\"]\n#######\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
