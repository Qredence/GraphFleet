{"result": "TRAVERSAL AFFORDANCES refer to a method that exploits the traversal affordances of graph indexes. These affordances are features of graph indexes that allow for efficient traversal and retrieval of information. This method leverages the inherent capabilities of graph structures to optimize the process of navigating through and extracting data from complex datasets, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of information retrieval in various applications.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
