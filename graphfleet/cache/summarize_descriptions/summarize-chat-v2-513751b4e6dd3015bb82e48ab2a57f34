{"result": "Graph communities are groups of elements, such as nodes, edges, and covariates, detected within a graph index and used for summarization. These communities consist of groups of nodes that have stronger connections to each other than to other nodes, identified using community detection algorithms. The levels of graph communities are also utilized in the analysis of Graph RAG (Region Adjacency Graph) systems, providing a structured way to understand and interpret the relationships and interactions within complex networks.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
