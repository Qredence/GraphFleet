{"result": "FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES are specialized instances provided to Large Language Models (LLMs) for in-context learning, aimed at tailoring the extraction prompt to the specific domain of the document corpus. These examples are used to train models in specific domains with minimal data, enhancing the model's ability to understand and process domain-specific information. Additionally, few-shot examples play a crucial role in the graph indexing process, ensuring that the data is accurately represented and indexed according to the domain requirements.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
