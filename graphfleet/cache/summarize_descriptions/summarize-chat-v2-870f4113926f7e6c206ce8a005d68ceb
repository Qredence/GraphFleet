{"result": "SELF-SELECTION BIAS is a potential bias that arises when individuals select themselves into a group, leading to a biased sample. In the context of productivity tools like GitHub Copilot, self-selection bias can occur when individuals who choose to use such tools may naturally experience higher job satisfaction. This bias can skew the evaluation of the tool's effectiveness, as the sample may not accurately represent the broader population. Understanding and mitigating self-selection bias is crucial for accurately assessing the impact and application of generative AI in professional workflows.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
