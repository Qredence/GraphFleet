{"result": "Naïve RAG is a basic form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that serves as a baseline method for comparison in various evaluation tasks. It is characterized by its simplicity and directness, often producing straightforward responses. However, it has certain drawbacks, such as being less comprehensive and diverse compared to more advanced global approaches. Naïve RAG does not employ advanced techniques like graph indexing, making it potentially inadequate for query-focused summarization tasks. Despite these limitations, it is frequently used to generate answers for questions in datasets, such as those from news articles, and to provide a benchmark for evaluating more sophisticated methods like the Graph RAG approach.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Artificial Intelligence and Productivity Research.
