-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

2 Graph RAG Approach & Pipeline
We now unpack the high-level data flow of the Graph RAG approach (Figure 1) and pipeline, de-
scribing key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.
2.1 Source Documents →Text Chunks
A fundamental design decision is the granularity with which input texts extracted from source doc-
uments should be split into text chunks for processing. In the following step, each of these chunks
will be passed to a set of LLM prompts designed to extract the various elements of a graph index.
Longer text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction, but suffer from the recall degrada-
tion of longer LLM context windows (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). This behavior can be
observed in Figure 2 in the case of a single extraction round
