-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

text:
 he tasks studied in the lab thus far have tended to 
be those for which researchers hypothesized generative AI would 
perform well . This was, in fact, the focus of most of the studies 
presented in the first AI and Productivity report we published  
(Cambon et al. 2023) . Actual information work , however, often 
includes a huge variety of tasks  and much of the unstructured and 
informal work in people’s jobs is not yet directly supported by the 
first-generation of generative AI tools.  Software developer 
workflows , for example,  involve far more than the hands-on coding supported by GitHub Copilot (Meyer et al. 2017). The ability to 
shed light on generative AI's productivity dynamics in the natural 
complexity of entire workflows is a key advantage of field studies 
of generative AI’s productivity impacts , and a major reason we 
hope to see many more field studies emerging in the literature
