-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

: The Second Microsoft Report on AI and Productivity 
Research. Microsoft.  
1 INTRODUCTION  
There is tremendous  interest in how AI can increase people’s 
productivity at work. To help meet this interest, in December 2023, 
Microsoft released a first AI and Productivity Report  (Cambon et 
al. 2023) synthesizing the results of many Microsoft studies on AI 
and productivity. These studies contributed to a large and growing 
literature from around the world and a wide variety of disciplines. 
Although there are exceptions, this literature largely points to a 
broad conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to 
introduce  a substantial step -function increase in productivity for tasks performed by information workers (e.g. , Noy and Zhang 
2023; Dell’Acqua et al. 2023; Brynjolfsson et al. 2023; Peng et al. 
2023).
