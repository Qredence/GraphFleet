all six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context
information used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.
The graph index supporting conditions C0-C3was created using our generic prompts for entity and
relationship extraction only, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the
data. The graph indexing process used a context window size of 600 tokens with 1 gleaning for the
Podcast dataset and 0 gleanings for the News dataset.
3.4 Metrics
LLMs have been shown to be good evaluators of natural language generation, achieving state-of-
the-art or competitive results compared against human judgements (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al.,
2024). While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are
known, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in The next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using
a method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in
their own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may
themselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question. For example, a user
may scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then
follow links to the reports at the lower level that provide more details for each of the subtopics. Here,
however, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.
Community summaries are generated in the following way:

7Question Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?
Graph
RAGOverview of Prominent Public Figures in Entertainment
The entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and
digital media. Certain public figures stand out due to their significant contributions and influence
across these sectors. The following summary highlights key individuals who are repeatedly
mentioned in various entertainment articles, reflecting their impact and presence within the industry.
Actors and Directors [...]Public Figures in Controversy [...]Musicians and Executives [...]
Athletes and Coaches [...]Influencers and Entrepreneurs [...]
The repeated mention of these figures in entertainment articles signifies their ongoing relevance and
the public’s interest in their work. Their influence spans across various aspects of entertainment, from
shaping cultural narratives in film and television to driving trends in music and digital media. These
individuals not only contribute to their respective fields but also influence the broader cultural , query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and
not just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent
years, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,
generic versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-
vant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on
the state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu
and Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam
et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al.,  diverse
answers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.
3.6 Results
The indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast
dataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset. Table 3 shows the
number of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.
Global approaches vs. na ¨ıve RAG . As shown in Figure 4, global approaches consistently out-
performed the na ¨ıve RAG ( SS) approach in both comprehensiveness and diversity metrics across
datasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 72-83%
for Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82%
and 62-71% respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test also achieved the expected  generated by the LLM based on short
descriptions of the target datasets. Questions target global understanding rather than specific details.

3.1 Datasets
We selected two datasets in the one million token range, each equivalent to about 10 novels of text
and representative of the kind of corpora that users may encounter in their real world activities:
•Podcast transcripts . Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,
Microsoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669
×600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1 million tokens).
•News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September
2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,
technology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 ×

Empowerment: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)
Answer 1 is better because it provides a comprehensive and structured overview of public figures
across various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music, sports, and
digital media. It lists multiple individuals, providing specific examples of their contributions and the
context in which they are mentioned in entertainment articles, along with references to data reports
for each claim. This approach helps the reader understand the breadth of the topic and make informed
judgments without being misled. In contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures
and primarily discusses their personal lives and relationships, which may not provide as broad an
understanding of the topic. While Answer 2 also cites sources, it does not match the depth and variety
of Answer 1  final round of
query-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.
“a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and
events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively ” (Klein et al., 2006a). Supporting
human-led sensemaking over entire text corpora, however, needs a way for people to both apply and
refine their mental model of the data (Klein et al., 2006b) by asking questions of a global nature.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to answering
user questions over entire datasets, but it is designed for situations where these answers are contained
locally within regions of text whose retrieval provides sufficient grounding for the generation task.
Instead, a more appropriate task framing is query-focused summarization (QFS, Dang, 2006), and in
particular  examples provided to the LLM for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020).
3For example, while our default prompt extracting the broad class of “named entities” like people,
places, and organizations is generally applicable, domains with specialized knowledge (e.g., science,
medicine, law) will benefit from few-shot examples specialized to those domains. We also support
a secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the
extracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt aims to extract claims linked to detected
entities, including the subject, object, type, description, source text span, and start and end dates.
To balance the needs of efficiency and quality, we use multiple rounds of “gleanings”, up to a
specified maximum, to encourage the LLM to detect any additional entities it may have missed
on prior extraction rounds. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess
whether all entities  resource-intensive approach requiring the highest number of context tokens.
Root-level community summaries ( C0) require dramatically fewer tokens per query (9x-43x).
Community summaries vs. source texts. When comparing community summaries to source texts
using Graph RAG, community summaries generally provided a small but consistent improvement
in answer comprehensiveness and diversity, except for root-level summaries. Intermediate-level
summaries in the Podcast dataset and low-level community summaries in the News dataset achieved
comprehensiveness win rates of 57% and 64%, respectively. Diversity win rates were 57% for
Podcast intermediate-level summaries and 60% for News low-level community summaries. Table 3
also illustrates the scalability advantages of Graph RAG compared to source text summarization: for
low-level community summaries ( C3), Graph RAG required 26-33% fewer context tokens, while
for root-level community summaries ( C0), it required over 97% fewer tokens.
