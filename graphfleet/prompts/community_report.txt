proportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and
Force Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels
of hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum
modularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.
•Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,
covariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until
the token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in
decreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add
descriptions of the source node, target node, linked covari AG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community
summaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-
trieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation
of community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)
or federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also
combined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and
multi-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab
et al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears , query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and
not just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent
years, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,
generic versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-
vant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on
the state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu
and Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam
et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al.,  of every hallucinated text part from the summary in

we focus here on showing the how the instructions are created and refined.
Seed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 18types
of text modification tasks including paraphrasing, expansion, simplification, redacting or
removing content, styling, code switching, etc. The full list is in Appendix A.
We define an Agent for each of the task type. Each agent takes as input a piece of text and
creates several text modification tasks of the associated type. Here we provide an example
input and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.

a map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently
and in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.
To evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-
making questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-
cast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-
sity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and
themes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries
used to answer queries, as well as compare to na ¨ıve RAG and global map-reduce summarization
of source texts. We show that all global approaches outperform na ¨ıve RAG on comprehensiveness
and diversity, and that Graph RAG with intermediate- and low-level community summaries shows  to a friend using casual and colloquial language,

92.3 AgentInstruct Flow for Tool Use
The task of tool use or API use for LLMs involves enabling models to interact with external
tools or services; via APIs. This capability allows AI systems to extend their functionality,
access external data, and perform actions beyond their native capabilities.
Content Transformation Flow We use source code snippets or an API description [ 26] as
the random seed. If source code  Classification Text classification is a type of machine learning task where text documents are
automatically classified into predefined categories. This can be used for spam detection, sentiment
analysis, and topic labelling among others.
Retrieval Augmented Generation Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method used
in natural language processing that combines retrieval-based and generative models to generate
responses. It first retrieves relevant documents and then uses these documents to generate a response.
Tool Use Tool use involves the manipulation of tools to achieve goals. In AI, this refers to the
ability of an AI system to use available resources or auxiliary systems to solve complex tasks.
Creative Content Generation Creative content generation involves the creation of original
content, often involving elements of novelty, value, and surprise. In AI, this could refer to generating
text, music, or images that are not only new but also meaningful and interesting.

Alex, knowing that Alex is already in a relationship. He might feel a bit
angry at himself for putting himself in this situation. There is a slight sense of
hopefulness in his confession, hoping that Alex might reciprocate his feelings.
He is also likely to feel embarrassed for putting Alex in an awkward position.

can create and reason over knowledge graphs in both Neo4J (NaLLM, Neo4J, 2024) and Nebula-

of these systems use the natural modularity of graphs to partition data for global summarization.
5 Discussion
Limitations of evaluation approach . Our evaluation to date has only examined a certain class of
sensemaking questions for two corpora in the region of 1 million tokens. More work is needed
to understand how performance varies across different ranges of question types, data types, and
dataset sizes, as well as to validate our sensemaking questions and target metrics with end users.

Role:. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.

# Report Structure
The report should include the following sections:
- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.
- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance of the text to computational linguistics and natural language processing, including advancements in retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge graph construction, summarization techniques, and the evaluation of large language models, with 1 being trivial or irrelevant and 10 being highly significant, impactful, and actionable in advancing the field.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.

# Grounding Rules
After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in Analysis:
