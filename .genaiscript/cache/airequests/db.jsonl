training, specifically creating data by powerful\nmodels to teach a new skill or behavior to another model, we refer to this setting as Generative\nTeaching.We introduce AgentInstruct, an extensible agentic framework for automatically\ncreating large amounts of diverse and high - quality synthetic data.AgentInstruct can create\nboth the prompts and responses, using only raw data sources like text documents and code\nfiles as seeds.We demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a post training dataset\nof 25M pairs to teach language models different skills, such as text editing, creative writing,\n    tool usage, coding, reading comprehension, etc.The dataset can be used for instruction\ntuning of any base model.We post - train Mistral - 7b with the data.When comparing\nthe resulting model(Orca - 3) to Mistral - 7b - Instruct(which uses the same base model), we\nobserve significant improvements across many benchmarks.For example, 40 % improvement\non AGIEval, 19 % improvement on MMLU, 54 % improvement on GSM8K, 38 % improvement\non BBH and 45 % improvement on AlpacaEval.Additionally, it consistently outperforms\nother models such as LLAMA - 8B - instruct and GPT - 3.5 - turbo.\n \n 0102030405060AGIEVAL\n010203040506070MMLU\n010203040506070BBH\n0102030405060708090GSM8K\n0510152025ALPACA\nEVAL\n0102030405060708090FOFO\n010203040506070MIRAGE -\n    RAG\n    + 40.2 % +19.4 %\n    +38.3 % +53.7 %\n    +45.0 % +38.3 %\n    +46.6 %\n    Mistral -

training(e.g., [1]), to instruction - tuning\n        (e.g., [21, 36]) and RLHF(e.g., [12, 28]).\nGenerating high quality synthetic data is hard: On the other hand, research has also\nshown that pre - training models on synthetic data generated by other models can lead to\nmodel collapse[29], leading to models gradually degenerating as a result.Similar arguments\nhave been made against using synthetic data for pos - training, which could amount to an\nimitation process that could teach the trained model to pick only stylistic characteristics\nand not real capabilities[8].This discrepancy could be explained by the observation that\ncreating high - quality and diverse synthetic data is hard[17].Successful use of synthetic data\ninvolved significant human effort in curating and filtering the data to ensure high quality.If\nwe focus on post - training synthetic data, we will see the most widely used approach includes\nstarting with a set of prompts and using a powerful model such as GPT-4[22] to generate\nresponses to these prompts[24] or of an expanded set of the prompts[36].This recipe\nwas further improved by eliciting explanations or step - by - step instructions from the teacher\nmodel[20] or using more complex prompting techniques to elicit higher quality answers [ 18].\nSynthetic data meets Agents: Another major development we witnessed last year is the\nrise of Agentic(especially multiagent) workflows[33, 13].Agentic workflows can generate\nhigh quality data, that surpasses the capabilities of the underlying LLMs, by using flows\nwith reflection and iteration, where agents can look back at solutions, generate critiques and\nimprove solutions.They can also use tools(e.g.search apis, calculator, code interpreters)\naddressing limitations of LLMs.Multi - agent workflows bring in additional benefits such\nas simulating scenarios where we can generate both new prompts and the corresponding\nresponses.They also enable automation of the data generation workflows reducing or\neliminating need for human intervention on some tasks.\nGenerative Teaching & Orca AgentInstruct: Generating synthetic data for post -\n    training often relies on an existing prompt set that is used as is or used as seeds for\ngenerating more instructions.In this work, we generalize the problem settings to a broader\nobjective of generating abundant amounts of diverse, challenging and high - quality data to\nteach a particular skill to an AI model, we refer to this setting as Generative Teaching.\nAgentInstruct is an agentic solution for Generative Teaching.AgentInstruct focuses on\ncreating demonstration and feedback data and requires only raw documents as input.When\ngeneric data is used as seeds, AgentInstruct can be used to teach an LLM a general capability\n    (e.g.Math, Reasoning, RAG, etc.).Domain specific data(e.g.gaming, finance) can also be\nused as seeds to improve the model in a certain specialization.AgentInstruct can create:\n1.High - quality data: using powerful models like GPT-4, coupled with tools like search\nand code interpreters.\n2.Diverse data: AgentInstruct generates both prompts and responses.It uses a large\nnumber of agents(equipped with powerful LLMs, tools and reflection flows) and a\ntaxonomy(of over 100 subcategories) to create diverse and high quality prompts\nand responses,\n    3.Large quantities of data: AgentInstruct can run autonomously and can apply flows\nfor verification and data filtering.It does not require seed prompts and uses raw\ndocuments for seeding.\nUsing raw data(unstructured text documents or source code) as seeds has two benefits.\n    First, this data is available in abundance enabling the use of AgentInstruct to create large\namounts of diverse data.Additionally, using raw data as seeds, and hence, avoiding using\nexisting prompts, as is or after paraphrasing, can promote learning more general capabilities\nas opposed to benchmark - specific ones.\nWe demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a comprehensive synthetic post -\n    training dataset of 25 million prompt and response pairs.The dataset covers a wide array\n2of skills including creative writing, reasoning, math, RAG, tool use, etc.To assess the\nvalue of the data, we use it to finetune Mistral - 7B[11] model.The finetuned Mistral model\n    (Orca - 3) shows significant improvement over other instruction - tuned models using the same\nbase model.For example, compared to Mistral - Instruct - 7B, it shows 40 % improvement on\nAGIEval, 19 % improvement on MMLU, 54 % improvement on GSM8K, 38 % improvement\non BBH, 45 % improvement on AlpacaEval and 31.34 % reduction on hallucination across\nmultiple summarization benchmarks.Additionally, it outperforms other models such as\n    LLAMA - 8B - instruct and GPT - 3.5 on multiple benchmarks.Note that the only seed data\nused is publicly available raw materials and no task - specific or benchmark data has been\nused as seeds.\n    WhilewedemonstratetheutilityofAgentInstructbycreatingagenericpost - trainingsynthetic\ndataset, we believe that agents can enable the creation of Synthetic - Data - Generation - As - A -\n    Service where we start with raw materials(e.g.web data for general model training or domain\nspecific data for specialized models), and we generate data for post - training and finetuning,\n    hence enabling continual learning and improvement of any base LLM.Additionally, we\nbelieve that the AgentInstruct approach can be used for self - improvement of larger, more\ncapable models because of: (1) the ability to generate new prompts and(2) the ability to\ngenerate responses that exceed the quality of the LLM used in the agentic flow(because of\nthe use of tools, reflection, etc.).\n2 Generative Teaching: AgentInstruct\nCreating synthetic datasets for supervised fine - tuning and instruction - tuning has seen\nsignificant progress over the last year.The quality of these datasets has been steadily\nimproving.High quality can be achieved by using powerful frontier models (or agenetic flows\nbased on these models) to generate responses.However, when creating synthetic data, in\n    addition to quality, we also need to consider several other fundamental questions:\n1. How can we create a vast amount of data ?\n    2. How can we ensure that the generated data is diverse ?\n        3. How can we generate complex or nuanced data points ?\n            In the AgentInstruct methodology, we outline a structured approach to tackle these challenges\nas follows:\nFigure 2: Concise Summary of the AgentInstruct Methodology\n1. Assemble a collection of raw seeds(e.g., textbook chapters, web articles, code\nsnippets).\n2.foreach seed in the collection do\n    3. Transform the seed with the aid of one or more content transformation Agents(\n        Content Transformation Flow).\n4. Route it through a series of instruction creation Agents to create a diverse set of\ninstructions(Seed Instruction Creation Flow).\n5. Utilize another group of Refinement Agents to iteratively refine the complexity\nand quality of the seed instructions(Refinement Flow).\n6.end for\nWe use agentic flows to automate the generation process and leverage raw articles as seeds to\nfoster diversity and ensure that problems generated in different iterations(line 2 in Figure 1)\nare distinct and of broad coverage.This enables us to create data at scale(benefiting from\nautomation of agentic flows), with high diversity(based on the broad and diverse seeds) and\nof varying complexity(benefiting from the iterative and refinement patterns supported by\nagentic flows).AgentInstruct defines three different flows:\nContent Transformation Flow converts the raw seed into an intermediate representation\nthat simplifies the creation of instructions tailored to specific objectives.It comprises of\n31\nContent Transformation Flow…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...………………\n………………\n………………\n……Raw text \ndocuments or \nsource code \nfiles are used \nas seedsTransformed\ncontent(e.g.  \nargument passage,\n    meeting transcript,\n    list of APIs,….)\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow\n……Transformed \ncontent provide \ndiversity is easier \nto use to generate \ninstructions Seed instructions \nare generated \nfollowing  a\ncomprehensive\ntaxonomy…...…...…...………………\n………………\n…………………...…...…...\n3\nInstruction Refinement Flow\nIteratively refine the instructions \nto boost quality, diversity and\ncomplexity\n2Figure 3: Figure provides a thematic overview of the roles played by different groups of\nagents.Content Transformation Flow converts the seed into an intermediate representation\nthat makes it easier to create high quality and diverse data.Seed Instruction Generation\nFlow creates instances of the target tasks following a taxonomy.Refinement Flow explores\nthe space further by starting from these initial data points and exploring the neighborhood.\nThe expectation is that by picking a random seed we will be able to cover the entire region\nof data points.\nmultiple agents and is often instrumental in the generation of high - quality data and serve as\n    an additional means to introduce diversity.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow comprising of multiple agents takes as input the\ntransformed seed from the Content Transformation Flow and generates a set of diverse\ninstructions.The only goal of the Seed Instruction Flow is to introduce diversity for which\nit often relies on a pre - defined, but extensible, taxonomy.\nInstruction Refinement Flow takes as input the instructions from the Seed Instruction\nFlow and iteratively enhances their complexity and quality.Towards this we use the concept\nof Suggester - Editor Agents[19].Suggester agents initially propose various approaches to\nincrease the intricacy of the initial instructions(making them more complex, unsolvable,\n    or tricky), after which the Editor agents modify the instructions in accordance with these\nsuggestions.\nEach flow consists of a number of agents.We use a generic definition of an agent, where an\nagent is powered by an LLM and can optionally have the ability to use tools such as search\nAPIs, code interpreter or a calculator.Each agent has a specific role and set of instructions\nspecified as part of the underlying LLM system message.\nWe implemented these flows for 17 different skills, each having multiple subcategories.\nThe skills include reading comprehension, question answering, coding, retrieval augmented\ngeneration, creative writing, tool / API use and Web control.The full list is provided in\n    Table 1\nWe explain how the workflows work with case studies of generating data for the following\nthree skills:\nReading Comprehension: The ability to understand, process, and interpret written text.\nText Modification: The process of altering text to suit different purposes.\nTool Use: The employment of functions or APIs to perform tasks or solve problems.\n4Reading Comprehension: Reading comprehension is a critical skill involving processing and un -\n    derstanding text, which is necessary for learning and encompasses decoding, fluency, and vocabulary\nknowledge.Reading comprehension tests typically present text passages of varying lengths and\nsubjects, followed by questions that assess the reader’s understanding.\nOpen Domain Question Answering: Open domain question answering involves generating\nresponses to questions over a wide range of topics, without being restricted to a specific domain.\nText Modification: Text modification involves changing existing text to improve its quality,\n    modify its tone, or to fit a specific context or audience.It is a common task in content creation and\nediting.\nWeb Agent: A web agent is a software program that autonomously performs tasks on the web,\n    such as where to click, how much to scroll.\nBrain Teaser A brain teaser is a problem or puzzle, typically requiring thought to solve, often for\namusement but also used for training logical thinking and problem - solving skills.\nAnalytical Reasoning Analytical reasoning involves the ability to look at information, be it\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, and discern patterns within the information.It’s a process\nthat includes understanding a system of relationships and draw logical conclusions about those\nrelationships.\nMultiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions are a form of assessment where respondents\nare asked to select the best possible answer(or answers) out of the choices from a list.They are\ncommon in standardized tests, quizzes, and surveys.\nData To Text Data - to - text refers to human - readable textual summaries from source data.These\ncould be used for generating reports, explanations, or narratives from structured data.\nFermiFermi problems are estimation problems which seek quick, rough estimates of quantities\nwhich can be difficult to measure.Named after physicist Enrico Fermi, these problems often require\nmaking justified guesses or assumptions to reach a solution.\nCoding Coding involves writing code following instructions, understanding code, debugging code,\n    tracing or writing test cases.\nText Extraction Text extraction is the process of retrieving relevant information from a larger text\ndocument.This can include tasks like named entity recognition, keyword extraction, or extracting\nspecific data fields from unstructured text.\nText Classification Text classification is a type of machine learning task where text documents are\nautomatically classified into predefined categories.This can be used for spam detection, sentiment\nanalysis, and topic labelling among others.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) is a method used\n    in natural language processing that combines retrieval - based and generative models to generate\nresponses.It first retrieves relevant documents and then uses these documents to generate a response.\nTool Use Tool use involves the manipulation of tools to achieve goals.In AI, this refers to the\nability of an AI system to use available resources or auxiliary systems to solve complex tasks.\nCreative Content Generation Creative content generation involves the creation of original\ncontent, often involving elements of novelty, value, and surprise.In AI, this could refer to generating\ntext, music, or images that are not only new but also meaningful and interesting.\nFew Shot Reasoning Few - shot reasoning refers to the ability of a machine learning model to\nunderstand new concepts, patterns, or tasks with minimal examples or guidance.It’s a desired trait\n    in AI, mimicking the human ability to learn quickly from few examples.\nConversation Conversation refers to conversational agents or chatbots that interact with humans\nin a natural, human - like manner.\n    Table 1: List of 17 capabilities for which we implemented AgentInstruct Flows\n52.1 AgentInstruct Flow for Reading Comprehension\nReading comprehension is a critical skill involving processing and understanding text, which\nis necessary for learning and encompasses decoding, fluency, and vocabulary knowledge.\nReading comprehension questions range from asking for explicit information(literal com -\n    prehension) to requiring inferences, understanding vocabulary in context, analyzing text\nstructure and argumentation, critically evaluating the content, and synthesizing informa -\n    tion from different parts of or multiple texts.Reading comprehension is a very important\ncapability and can enable scenarios like question answering, search, grounded reasoning, etc.\nContent Transformation Flow Web crawls encompass an extensive collection of human -\n    generated text, which holds potential for generating reading comprehension materials.\n        However, these sources are not inherently structured to facilitate the teaching of read -\n            ing comprehension skills.Consequently, they do not support the consistent generation of\ndiverse question types required for comprehensive reading comprehension evaluation.For\ninstance, the LSAT Logical Reasoning test features specialized question categories, including\nassumption, strengthening / weakening, flaw, and inference questions.Crafting such questions\nnecessitates passages with a particular stylistic and logical framework.The objective of\nContent Transformation Flow is to transform arbitrary articles into well - crafted pieces that\nare conducive to the formulation of a wide array of reading comprehension question types.\nOur current flow for Reading Comprehension encompasses a suite of nine content transfor -\n    mation agents for generating argument passages, debates and conversations, long passages,\n        meeting transcripts, poems, satarical content, etc.Detailed description is provided in Ap -\n            pendix A.Given a seed article, the flow will randomly pick one of the Content Transformation\nAgents to assess the seed article and attempt to generate the text passages.The following\nprovides an example for the Argument Passage Generator.\n    EXAMPLE: Content Transformation Flow\nRandom Seed\nUric acid is a substance produced naturally by the breakdown of purine(a type of dietary\nprotein).When it is in excess in the body, crystals composed of these substances are formed.\nThese crystals are deposited in various parts of the body, mainly in the joints and kidneys,\n    causing pain and other aggravations.The lack or excess of uric acid in the body is caused by\nsome diseases(such as leukemia, obesity, kidney diseases, and anemia) and factors related\nto lifestyle(consumption of alcohol and processed foods, for example).\n    Contents\n•Where does purine come from ?\n•Where is uric acid found ?\n•What is high uric acid ?\n•What can high uric acid cause ?\n•What is low uric acid ?\n•Tests: how to know uric acid levels ?\n    Where does purine come from ?\n        Purine is produced and released into the bloodstream when an amino acid is broken down\nby digestion.Therefore, it is produced naturally in the body. ... (Truncated)\n6Transformed Seed(Argument Passage Generator)\nRecent studies have indicated that high levels of uric acid in the blood, known as hyper -\n    uricemia, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.Uric acid is a byproduct of purine\nmetabolism, and while it is naturally produced in the body, excessive amounts can lead to\nhealth complications.Hyperuricemia is typically defined as levels above 6 mg / dL in women\nand 7 mg / dL in men.This condition can result from increased production of uric acid or\ninsufficient elimination through urine.Factors contributing to high uric acid include a diet\nrich in purines, found in red meat and seafood, as well as lifestyle choices such as alcohol\nconsumption and physical inactivity.Conversely, low levels of uric acid, or hypouricemia,\n    are less common and usually do not present symptoms.Nonetheless, they can be indicative\nof underlying kidney or liver issues.Diagnosing either condition requires laboratory blood\nand urine tests.It is important to note that while high uric acid levels are associated with\nan increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the causal relationship remains to be conclusively\nestablished.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 43\nreading comprehension questions types.The list includes literal comprehension questions,\n    critical comprehension questions, evaluative comprehension questions, reasoning, identifying\nassumptions, identifying information that strengthens / weakens an argument, ordering events,\n    etc.\nA list some of these types is in Appendix A.\nWe have defined multiple Agents targeting these categories.Each of these agent receives as\n    input a piece of text and generates a list of questions based on a predefined question type.\nThe orchestration process will engage a subset of these agents, determined by the content\ntransformation agent in the preceding step.Upon completion of this phase, we will obtain a\ncollection of(passage, question) pairs that will constitute the input for the subsequent stage.\nThe following figure provides an example of Strengthen type question that is generated from\nthe running example.\n    EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nWhich one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument that high lev -\n    els of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease ?\n        (A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid levels in the\nblood.\n(C) Dietary supplements have been shown to reduce uric acid levels in the blood.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found to have\nuric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease are more likely to have high\nuric acid levels.\nInstruction Refinement Flow The refinement flow contains multiple suggester - editor\nagents that will go through each of the(passage, question) pairs and create more such pairs\nwith the following goals: (1) Modify the passage to make the question unanswerable, (2)\nModify the passage to alter the answer, if possible, in opposite direction, or(3) Modify the\nquestions or answer choices(if applicable) to make them complex.\nHere is an example where the suggester agent that tries to add a difficult distractor to\nconfuse the test taker.\n7EXAMPLE: Refinement Flow\nSUGGESTER\n•Suggestion 1 Introduce a hypothetical study or finding that could potentially\nstrengthen the argument, requiring the test - taker to infer its impact on the rela -\n    tionship between uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease.\n•Suggestion 2 Add a layer of complexity by suggesting a genetic predisposition\nto hyperuricemia and its correlation with increased cardiovascular events, which\nwould require the test - taker to consider both genetic and physiological factors.\n•Suggestion 3 Include a distractor option that seems to strengthen the argument\nbut upon closer examination, it does not directly relate to the causal relationship\nbetween uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease, thus testing the test - taker’s\nability to discern relevant from irrelevant information.\n    EDITOR\n•Modification 1, 2(omitted for brevity)\n•Modification 3 Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument\nthat high levels of uric acid increase the risk of cardiovascular disease ?\n    (A) Some individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop cardiovascular disease.\n(B) Physical activity has been found to have no significant impact on uric acid\nlevels in the blood.\n(C) A placebo - controlled trial shows that individuals taking uric acid - lowering\nmedication do not exhibit a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease compared\nto the placebo group.\n(D) A significant number of patients with cardiovascular disease have been found\nto have uric acid levels above the defined thresholds for hyperuricemia.\n(E) A cross - sectional study finds that high uric acid levels are associated with other\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but does\nnot establish a direct causal link.\n2.2 AgentInstruct Flow for Text Modification\nText modification is the process of editing and refining written content to enhance its quality\nand effectiveness or alter its attributes.This involves correcting spelling and grammar,\n    clarifyingideas, reorganizingcontentforbetterflow, adjustingtone, ensuringstyleconsistency,\n    fact - checking, removingredundancies, formatting, developingcontent, andadaptingtospecific\naudiences.It is a useful skill for LLMs that help in content writing.While several content\ntransformation agents can be introduced to intentionally modify the text as described earlier,\n    we focus here on showing the how the instructions are created and refined.\nSeed Instruction Generation Flow We have currently compiled a collection of 18types\nof text modification tasks including paraphrasing, expansion, simplification, redacting or\nremoving content, styling, code switching, etc.The full list is in Appendix A.\nWe define an Agent for each of the task type.Each agent takes as input a piece of text and\ncreates several text modification tasks of the associated type.Here we provide an example\ninput and a task created by the Paraphrasing Agent.\n8EXAMPLE: Seed Instruction\nRandom Seed\nApril 6 -

financial corporations as well as the banking\nand finance industry, and 3) a discourse of risk - taking, self - management and self - fulfillment\nthat is transforming people into investing subjects.Some anthropological skeptics, however,\n    argue that finance has a far longer genealogy than the financialization literature has to date\nrecognized.For example, in the context of a lengthy human history of creating hierarchy,\n    financialization may simply be a new technology serving an old purpose.\n...

via APIs.This capability allows AI systems to extend their functionality,\n    access external data, and perform actions beyond their native capabilities.\nContent Transformation Flow We use source code snippets or an API description[26] as\n    the random seed.If source code snippets has been used as the seed, a content transformation\nagent is used to synthesize an API description from the code snippet.The goal of the\nContent Transformation Flow is to synthesize list of APIs from the random seed.API lists\nare created by either: (1) using an API retrieval agent that iteratively searches for similar\ncode to expand the API list or(2) the agent uses the LLM to hypothesize other APIs present\n    in the library.\nThe following figure provides an example of the library reconstruction scenario.\n    EXAMPLE: Content Transformation Flow[Library Reconstruction]\nSeed\n{\n    \"name\": \"View All Food Items\",\n        \"description\": \"The request enables clients to obtain a detailed list of food items,\ncomplete with nutritional profiles such as calorie count, protein, fat, ...\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n            \"limit\": {\n                \"type\": \"NUMBER\",\n                    \"description\": \"limit the length of response\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"required\": []\n    }\n}\nReconstructed Remaining APIs from the Library\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Search Food Items\",\n        \"description\": \"Allows clients to search for food items by name and retrieve a list of\nmatching items ...\",\n\"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"query\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"The name or partial name of the food item to search for.\"\n                },\n                \"limit\": {\n                    \"type\": \"number\",\n                    \"description\": \"Optional parameter to limit the number of search results\nreturned.\"\n}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\n                \"query\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    10{\n    \"name\": \"Get Food Item Details\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Create Meal Plan\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Update Food Item\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Track User Meal\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Get Dietary Recommendations\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Add New Food Item\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Delete Food Item\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Get User Nutritional Stats\",\n        \"description\": \"...\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n...\n    }\n}\n]\nSeed Instruction Creation Flow The seed instruction creation flow, consume the list of\nAPIs and employs variety of agents to create several tasks of the following types:\n1. Tasks that require the use of a single API:\n11(a) Tasks where the input supplies all necessary parameters.\n(b) Tasks where the input includes superfluous parameters.\n(c) Tasks where the input is missing some required parameters.\n2.

We refer to this data as Orca - 2.5 -\n    dataset.\nThe culmination of these datasets results in approximately 25.8 million paired instructions,\n    all of which are incorporated into the training of Orca - 3. Furthermore, we have trained a\nseparate model, referred to as Orca - 2.5, using the 3.8 million instructions(Orca - 2.5 - dataset).\nThe purpose of this is to compare and evaluate the impact of the 22 million instructions\ncurated through AgentInstruct.\n3.2 Training Details\nWe use the 25.8 million paired instructions described earlier to finetune Mistral - 7b - v0.1.\nWe choose this model because the it makes the weights publicly available for the base\n    (no - instruction - tuned) version, with a permissive license allowing easy redistribution.We\nrefer to the finetuned model(Mistral - 7b - v0.1 finetuned on AgentInstruct dataset) as Orca - 3.\nEach pair in the dataset undergoes a tokenization process using the Mistral tokenizer,\n    ensuring a maximum sequence length of 8192 with packing.To guarantee that the training\nloss is calculated based only on the response conditioned on the prompt, label masking is\napplied.Weight decay was set at 0.1\nThe finetuneing used 19 NVIDIA A100 nodes, or 152 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with a\nbatch size of 10. We used AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 8e-6 and a a\ncosine learning rate schedule.We also used a linear learning rate warm - up during the initial\n500 steps.The model was trained for three epochs and the training process concluded after\napproximately 200 hours.\n4 Evaluation Results\n4.1 Orca - Bench\nThe Orca - Bench dataset serves as a held - out test set, consisting of 100 samples from each of\nthe 17 skills for which data was curated using AgentInstruct, except for the Open Domain\nQuestion Answering(ODQA) category, where we created two test sets.The first subset,\n    referred to as ODQA, consists of 100 questions originated from the initial seed instruction\nphase.The second subset, termed Complex ODQA, includes more intricate questions\ndeveloped during the refinement phase.\nWe evaluated the performance of all baselines using the Orca-Bench dataset.These were\nscored relative to GPT - 4 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. It is worth noting that some of\nthe entries within Orca - Bench involve multiple exchanges.To illustrate, let a multi - turn\ninteraction in Orca - Bench be denoted by the sequence(system message, user 1, assistant,\n    user 2, assistant, ...), where each turn is crafted by GPT4(teacher).For every user iinput, we\ngenerateacorresponding studentresponse, which isconditionedontheprecedingconversation\nhistory as established by the teacher.We then evaluate the student’s generated response\n14Figure 4: Performance Comparison between Baselines and Orca3 Checkpoints.Scores are\nrelative to GPT - 4 with the outer circle denoting GPT - 4’s score of 10.\nagainst the original teacher’s response, rating each on a scale from 0 to 10. To calculate a\nstudent’s overall score, we sum the student’s individual scores and divide this total by the\nsum of the teacher’s scores.This ratio is then multiplied by 10 to normalize the student’s\nfinal score to a 0 to 10 scale.\n    AgentInstruct’s objective is to synthesize a large and diverse corpus of data with varying\ndegrees of difficulty.An efficacious execution of this strategy should yield a dataset against\nwhich baseline models like Orca - 2.5, Mistral - Instruct - 7b, and ChatGPT score substantially\nbelow 10, demonstrating their relative inferiority to GPT - 4—a model that is designated as\n    the benchmark with a score of 10. The performance comparison, as depicted in Figure 4,\n        illustrates the comparative analysis between baseline models and Orca - 3 .This figure shows\nthe notable enhancement in a broad spectrum of capabilities during post - training, enabled\nby the AgentInstruct data.\n    Table 2 encapsulates the average(macro) scores across all assessed dimensions.On average,\n        including orca - 3 after each training epoch, the inclusion of AgentInstruct data has led to\na performance augmentation of 33.94 % over the Orca 2.5 baseline and an enhancement of\n14.92 % over Mistral - Instruct - 7B.\n4.2 Benchmark Results\nWe evaluate Orca - 3 against 5 baseline models including Orca - 2.5, Mistral - 7B - Instruct - v0.3,\n    LLAMA3 - 8B - Instruct, GPT - 3.5 - turbo and GPT - 4 on the following benchmarks:\n15Model Orca -

Bench: The Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark(ACI - Bench)[32] is a\ndataset designed for benchmarking automatic report generation from doctor - patient\nconversations.The test set comprises 120 data points.\n•InstruSum: A dataset[15] for evaluating the generation capabilities LLMs for\ninstruction - controllable summarization.It consists of 100 datapoints.\n•Orca - Sum: A newly created benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ ability to follow summa -\n    rization and grounded data transformation instructions.To construct this test set,\n        we sampled data from 45 summarization datasets collected from Hugging Face across\nmultiple domains such as news, conversations, science, health, social, e - mails, code,\n    etc.for a total of 458 datapoints.We randomly collected, up to 1000 datapoints\nwhich then we carefully deduplicated to avoid overlapping with the training set.We\nthen used GPT - 4 to generate a set of 40 prompts for each dataset out of each we\nrandomly sampled one for each selected datapoint.The prompts are dataset - specific\nand focus on summarization, grounding, and data transformation.For instance, a\nprompt may ask the model to generate a TikTok video out of a scientific paper or\na legal contract from a Wikipedia page.This allows us to measure not only the\nquality of the response but also hallucination in a challenging scenario, as the model\nis forced to move between formats and domains.\nThe results are presented in Table 7. With the AgentInstruct approach, we successfully\nachieved a reduction in hallucinations by 31.34 %, while attaining a quality level comparable\nto GPT4(Teacher).\n4.7 Evaluation: RAG\nThe RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) skill significantly boosts the capacity of Lan -\n    guage Models to generate informed, contextually precise responses, hence upgrading their\noverall performance and usefulness.It is arguably more effective to test the RAG proficiency\nof language models in areas where the models have limited knowledge.For this study, we\nselected MIRAGE[35], a benchmark that focuses on answering medical questions by referring\nto information retrieved from a medical corpus.Since the medical domain is not typically a\nprimary focus of the models evaluated in this study, MIRAGE provides an effective platform\nfor assessing their RAG capabilities.Additionally, AgentInstruct RAG data used generic,\n    non medical data seed, enabling us to test how well can the skill(RAG) be applied to new\n        domains.\n19ModelOrca -

7B - Instruct respectively.\nCoT shows the performance of the same models when answering directly without using RAG\nWe use the same retrieval mechanism across all models on MIRAGE[35], using MedRAG,\n    the corpus accompanying the benchmark.This involves using the same retrieval function\n    and the same number of retrieved documents for all models.As all models are presented\nwith the same set of retrieved documents, the comparison accurately reflects the ability of\ndifferent models to incorporate retrieved results into their responses.\n    Table 8 shows the results of all models on MIRAGE with and without leveraging RAG1.\n        Overall, we observe that\n•Models with a deeper understanding of the task(CoT scores) tend to have higher\nRAG scores.If we restrict our focus to only RAG performance, applying post -\n    training, we’ve managed to enhance Mistral’s performance by an average of 38.30 %.\n1Results of GPT - 4 and GPT - 3.5 - Turbo are from[35].\n20•Of the five datasets in MIRAGE, PubMedQA arguably offers the most effective\ntestbed for assessing models ability to do RAG.In PubMedQA, all models have\nlimited prior knowledge, and the retrieved context provides essential information, as\ndemonstrated by GPT4’s performance leap.All Mistral fine - tunes exhibit similar\nperformance, but only Orca - 3(Mistral trained with AgentInstruct RAG flow data)\nshows a substantial improvement, resulting in a relative improvement of 92.71 % over\nMistral - Instruct.\n5 Limitations\nAgentInstruct reduces human expertise required for data generation significantly and enables\ncreating of high - quality synthetic data at scale.However, this is till an early step in this\ndirection and could suffer from many limitations associated with synthetic data generation,\n    including but not limited to:\nExtensibility: Creating the agentic flows for different skills depends on human effort for\nthe construction of the flows.Future work should consider how to automate the construction\nof the agentic flow from the user specification.\n    Accuracy: Synthetic data may not perfectly replicate the complexity and nuances of real -\n        world data, leading to potential inaccuracies.Additional work is needed to better assess the\nquality of the data.\n    Cost: Generating synthetic data with multiple agents using LLMs and tools can be resource-\n        intensive.\n            Bias:If the original seed data used to generate synthetic data contains biases, these biases\ncan be reflected and even amplified in the synthetic data.\n    Validation : It can be difficult to validate synthetic data to ensure it accurately represents\nthe desired scenarios.\nDependency on Seed Data: The quality of synthetic data is dependent on the quality of\nthe real data used as seeds.Poor quality input data could result in poor quality synthetic\ndata.\n    Orca - 3 is fine - tuned with the AgentInstruct data based on the Mistral model family, and\nretains many of its limitations, as well as the common limitations of other large language\nmodels and limitations originating from its training process, including:\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\nbiases present in the source data.Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\nas “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\ndecisions.We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information2.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\ncan cause.It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\nactions to prevent them.It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\nprovided by different companies and institutions.On an important note, we hope for better\nregulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms\nfor AI technologies in future.We value and acknowledge the important role that research\nand open source community can play in this direction.\n    Hallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given\nlanguage model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is\nnot obvious how to prevent these models from fabricating content.Moreover, it is not clear\nwhether small models may be more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation\nuse cases due to their smaller sizes and hence reduced memorization capacities.This is an\n2https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/\ntransparency - note\n21active research topic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding\nand mitigations around this topic.\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could\nbe maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\nData Distribution: Orca - 3’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution\nof the tuning data.This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in\n    the training dataset.\n6 Conclusions\nThe AgentInstruct approach to Generative Teaching offers a promising solution to the\nchallenge of generating large amount of diverse and high - quality data for model post - training.\nThis method stands out by using agentic flows for synthetic data generation, thus addressing\nkey concerns associated with the use of synthetic data in model training, such as the lack of\ndiversity and the need for intensive human curation and intervention during the data creation\nprocess.By leveraging an agentic framework, AgentInstruct can generate tailored datasets\ncomprising both prompts and responses from unstructured data sources, facilitating the\npost - training of models and teaching them variety of skills.The efficacy of this approach is\nexemplifiedbythesubstantialimprovementobserved intheOrca - 3 model, which, post - trained\nwith a 25M pair dataset generated by AgentInstruct, showcased a notable performance gain\nacross multiple benchmarks.We believe using agentic flows for creating synthetic data can\nshow significant value for all stages of model training, including pre - training, post - training\nand domain / task specialization.The ability to use unstructured content to generate diverse\nand high - quality instruction data given any specifications could pave the way for creating\n    (semi) automated pipelines using synthetic data for model customization(using domain\nspecific content as seeds) and continual improvement(generating higher quality data than\nthe base model with agentic flows).\nReferences\n[1]Marah Abdin, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah,\n    Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, Amit Bahree, Arash Bakhtiari, Jianmin Bao, Harkirat Behl,\n        Alon Benhaim, Misha Bilenko, Johan Bjorck, Sébastien Bubeck, Qin Cai, Martin Cai, Caio\nCésar Teodoro Mendes, Weizhu Chen, Vishrav Chaudhary, Dong Chen, Dongdong Chen,\n    Yen -

We use the judge system message provided in the original paper of the\n                                    benchmark [ 34]. GPT-4 is used to give a format correctness score between 0\n                                    and 1, 1 meaning the model’s response strictly follows the format specified in\n                                    the prompt and 0 otherwise. The final score is measured as the percentage of\n                                    times the model being evaluated followed the format specified in the prompt\n                                    strictly.\n                                    –IFEval: IFEval benchmark requires checking if the model response follows the\n                                    verifiable instructions given in the prompt.
