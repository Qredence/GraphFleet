# GraphRAG

GraphRAG is an advanced information retrieval and question answering system that combines the power of graph-based knowledge representation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## Features

- Graph-based knowledge representation
- Efficient information retrieval
- Integration with large language models for question answering
- Customizable indexing and querying strategies
- Support for various data sources and formats

## Installation

To install GraphRAG, use Poetry:

```bash
poetry add graphrag
```

Or if you're using pip:

```bash
pip install graphrag
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from graphrag.index import create_index
from graphrag.query import query_graph

# Create an index from your data
index = create_index("./data", config="./config.yaml")

# Query the graph
result = query_graph(index, "What is the capital of France?")
print(result)
```

## Configuration

GraphRAG can be configured using a YAML file. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
llm:
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  temperature: 0.7

indexing:
  chunk_size: 1000
  overlap: 200

retrieval:
  top_k: 5
  similarity_threshold: 0.7
```
